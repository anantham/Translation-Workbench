  1. Diction & Lexical Nuance (1-100) üéØ English Sophistication or üß† Vocabulary Complexity - Nuanced, complex language usage, Vocabulary - Employ varied, precise vocabulary (furious/incensed/livid instead of repeated "angry"), 100 means Precision without pretension, using extremely niche, archaic, obscure words. Maintain distinct character voices through speech patterns, formality levels, and vocabulary choices. A more varied and nuanced vocabulary could elevate the prose. For instance, instead of just "powerful," words like "indomitable," "cataclysmic," "overwhelming," or "resplendent" could be used depending on the context. 1 means very simple english, most accessible to the widest audience while 100 means employing a rich and sophisticated vocabulary. You are highly encouraged to use niche, obscure, complex, nuanced, specific, or less common words to precisely capture the original text's meaning.

  2. üåç World Building & Imagery (1-100) - Rich descriptions, terminology and context, footnotes/glossary that details choices to transliterate in Pinyin, deep cultural/historical references. maintain consistency. üåè Cultural Context - 1 would mean finding the closest equivalent terms, phrases that are colloquial and relatable. 100 means preserving the cultural, mythological, historical context as much as possible, adding footnotes to explain the quirks of the culture and language that allow such etymologies, connections and meaning. Accurate, consistent use of domain-specific names and jargon (e.g., cultivation techniques, sect names, qi types)

  3. üíî Emotional Impact (1-100) - How evocative the prose is, creativity - Balance epic grandeur with humor and modern colloquialisms where character-appropriate. Handle poetry/wordplay by preserving effect over literal meaning. Your task is to convey the meaning, tone, and impact of the original. Literary flair where instead of "Fang Han was shocked" or "Jin Shi Tai was furious." A more impactful approach would be to describe the physical and mental sensations of these emotions: "A jolt of ice shot through Fang Han's veins," or "A savage sneer twisted Jin Shitai's features, his aura flaring with murderous rage."

  4. üí¨ Dialogue Naturalness (1-100) - Authentic conversation flow, no jarring transitions in the transitions between sentences, paragraphs, chapters. Formatting - Readability - Add sufficient line breaks between each speaker's dialogue, line breaks between scene transitions or time skips. Lines like, "You, a powerless outer court disciple, dare to lecture me on sect rules?" are a very literal translation of the sentiment. A more natural English equivalent might be, "You dare lecture me on the rules? An ant from the outer court?" or "The sheer audacity! Who are you, a mere outer disciple, to speak of rules to me?"

  5. Voice & Stylization - ‚úçÔ∏è Prose Style - 1 would be consise, brief and rapid pacing of narrative flow, compressed and rapid. 100 would be Flowery and descriptive. Linger on the details of landscapes, the texture of clothing, the choreography of combat, and the inner emotional state of characters. The pace is slow and immersive. üé® Creative Fidelity - 1 would mean just a literal translation, while 100 would mean your goal is to intuit the author's intent, tone, and evoke the same emotional impact in the reader, you may rephrase sentences and take creative liberty to create a more compelling experience. careful translation that fully adheres to accurate, truthful translation. don‚Äôt deviate from the plot or facts. Here we want more description, more words!
  


Bonus points for,

Idiomatic & Cultural Expression. Thematic English Equivalent. Original: ÁîªËõáÊ∑ªË∂≥ (hu√† sh√© tiƒÅn z√∫) - "drawing a snake and adding feet." Equivalent: "Gilding the lily" or "A superfluous action." Add micro-footnotes for minor terms: "Kui Star Kicks the Dipper‚Äîa reference to the Kui star, celestial embodiment of scholarly fury in Chinese astrology."

Use metaphors and analogies - for example in the case of pain: "The Shura‚Äôs strike wasn‚Äôt impact‚Äîit was a mountain range collapsing into his marrow." For demonic aura: "The pressure didn‚Äôt weigh; it unmade, scraping his sanity like rust from a blade."

Go beyond visual imagery. What does qi circulation sound like? A low hum? A rushing river? What is the specific sound of a sword cleaving the air‚Äîa whistle, a shriek, a hum? Describe the feel of qi. Is it a "warm current" or a "chilling torrent"? Is a magic robe "as smooth as water" or "as coarse as burlap"? What is the "scent of paradise" mentioned? Is it like ozone after a storm, or like blooming night-jasmine? What does a demon's den smell of‚Äîbrimstone, decay, or something alien? When a character eats a spirit fruit, what does it taste like? "A burst of honey and summer rain." Add tactile/olfactory layers: "The Blood Pellet exuded an iron-scented warmth, like a forge-heated ingot clutched in his palm." For locations, expand: "The Demon God‚Äôs Altar loomed like a necrotic tooth, its obsidian surface weeping vapors that reeked of forsaken graves."

A character's internal and external voice should change based on their experiences. Use italics, quotes to showcase the difference. Use italics for internal thoughts to clearly separate a character's internal panic from their external bravado. Differentiate dialects‚Äîe.g., make demons hiss sibilants ("Sssurrender, little meat"), while immortals speak in clipped cadences.

Other formatting can be maintaining logical pacing by using scene breaks or blank lines between time skips and avoiding overly long paragraphs. 

Reimagine Technique Names: While literal translations are accurate, they can be clunky.
Original: Áû¨ÊùÄÂ§ßÊ≥ï (Sh√πn ShƒÅ D√† F«é) - "Instant Kill Great Way."
Alternative: "The Art of the Unseen Strike," "The Way of Instantaneous Death," or simply the "Instant-Kill Art." The goal is to find a name that sounds as intimidating and cool in English as it does in Chinese.
