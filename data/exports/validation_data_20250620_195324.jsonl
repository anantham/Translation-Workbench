Borrowing the momentum from the huge impact, the long-hilted saber swept away the oncoming black shadow.\n\"BAM!\"\nThe black shadow slammed into the ground, rolled over a few times and emitted a pained growl. The torch cast its light onto it now that it appeared in its range.\nIt was a wild wolf! Its waist had been cut wide open by his saber!\nBefore he could think about it further, two other wild wolves pounced towards him from the dark.\nHis body reacted in the first second by instinct.\nTilting the long-hilted saber leftwards, he blocked one of the wild wolves with its long hilt. Then, with a swing of his body, he threw that wolf onto the other beast.\n\"Bang!\"\nThese two effortful motions left him wanting in strength. He was but a frail and skinny rich man’s kid not too long ago, after all.\nThe two wild wolves were thrown into the distance, hurt.\nPanting heavily and red-eyed, Lu Sheng lifted his saber and unleashed a Tiger Kill on the nearest wild wolf!\nThe blade sliced down from above, inclining slightly. His wrists vibrated vigorously – they shook thrice continuously, as per the rate dictated by the mantra.\n\"Whoosh!\"\nThe roar of a fierce tiger seemed to ring in the air.\nStruck with fear, the two wild wolves trembled and their movements lapsed by a beat.\nAt that instant, light flashed across the blade of the long-hilted saber. One of the beasts was beheaded on the spot with a clean saber stroke.\nThe tip of the saber had also nicked the other wolf’s neck, and blood was rapidly seeping out of it.\nLu Sheng mustered up his strength and struck again. This time, it was Tiger Might.\nHis forearm vibrated four times, employing a different level of force each time. The strength of his entire body was channeled into the saber.\nTiger Might emphasized speed more than Tiger Kill did, compromising slightly on strength in return. Nonetheless, it wasn’t something the fragile neck of a mere wild wolf could withstand.\nBefore the wolf could dodge, it was struck squarely in the neck by the long-hilted saber that sped up drastically without warning.\n\"Splat!\"\nThe wolf’s head fell on the ground.\nLu Sheng sucked in huge mouthfuls of air, panting heavily.\nThe continuous series of big movements had left a layer of sweat on his face.\n\"HOWL…\"\nOne more wild wolf remained – the one which went for the meat.\nNow, it went around a rock, its two green eyes staring furiously at Lu Sheng.\n‘My body’s too weak after all…’ Frustration gathered in Lu Sheng’s heart.\nHowever, his face remained impassive. He understood that when facing off against a wild beast, one must never back off or show even a hint of fear.\n\"Eh!?\"\nBoth his eyes opened wide in a stare as he glared fiercely at the wolf.\nThe last wild wolf focused its stare on him for a moment longer before slowly retreating backwards. Finally, it completely slipped into the darkness.\nOnly then did Lu Sheng breathe in relief.\nActually, his stamina was almost completely spent. Both his arms were sore and weak, even to the point of trembling when grasping his saber.\nIf that wild wolf had really pounced on him... while he was certain that he would survive, he wouldn’t remain unscathed either.\nHe waited till he was sure that the wild wolf had really left. Then, Lu Sheng retrieved the torch and left hurriedly in the direction of Nine Links City.\nWith this trip, he now knew where he stood.\nUncle Zhao had once mentioned his glorious past in connection with the wild wolves outside the city.\nAfter achieving full mastery of his saberplay in his youth, he had once been surrounded and attacked by three wild wolves. Armed with nothing but a single-handed saber, he slaughtered all three wolves at the cost of a mild injury to his forearm.\nThis had already set a terrific battle score.\nThe wild wolves in this world were completely different from those that Lu Sheng knew.\nTheir bodies were larger – each one much larger than the wild wolves on Earth. They were much stronger as well.\nAlmost the same as the big golden retrievers people kept as pets. [1]\nAnother difference between wild wolves here and on Earth was that those here gathered in packs of three to five. Very rarely would there be large packs of them.\nLu Sheng jogged back to the city gates. When the light of the torches on the city walls came into view, he felt a sense of relief.\nRolling up the clothes on him, he hid the blood-stained spots and his long-hilted sabre, took out his travel pass, and strode towards the city gates.\n***\n\"Brother Sheng, Brother Sheng, listen to me! This ain’t ordinary stuff. Right after reaching Zi Hua City, I had people bring it here from over there.\nRumor has it that in the Central Plains it is considered the Number One Legendary Stone. Countless merchants and nobles bid and fought for it. Finally, in an accident, it fell into the river and the waves brought it to Zi Hua River. Then it was fished out of the waters by the fishermen of Zi Hua City.\nI can’t tell you the twists and turns of this story in just a few words. If not for…\"\n\"Do I look like a fool to you?\" Lu Sheng gently waved his fan and looked at a fatso before him with a faint smile.\nThis fatso was called Zheng Xiangui. He was the second son of the boss of the Precious & Famous Auction House in Nine Links City.\nAs well as Lu Sheng’s best friend from his past.\nLu Sheng and he grew up as brothers from another mother. They clicked impeccably with each other and went through all troubles together, sharing thick and thin. [2]\nIt’s just that Zheng Xiangui had a bad habit. It was his tendency to wallow in greed.\nIn his own words, he would say that even biological brothers had to keep clear scores, otherwise their relationship would sour sooner or later.\nBoth of them were sitting in Goldfish Restaurant’s Peony Room. A well-endowed lady dressed in pink sat beside the fatso, reclining in his arms.\nThis lad was now staring at Lu Sheng with a pained expression.\n\"Brother Sheng, now that’s where you’re wrong. Your brother here took great pains to find a rare treasure. And now here he is, giving you the opportunity to bid for it in private before it gets auctioned. It’s fine if you don’t value it, but how can you ridicule me?\" Fatso pointed at Lu Sheng, looking as if he was immensely grieved.\n\"Alright, alright. Don’t pull that trick on me. Have you gotten news about the martial arts manuals I’m looking for?\" Lu Sheng continued to ask.\nHe came looking for this blood brother of his in order to gather more martial arts manuals.\nOne Black Tiger Saber Technique was not enough. Not even close.\nHe finally understood the chances of survival out in the wild an expert like Uncle Zhao had.\nNo wonder he had never heard of anyone journeying out in the distance alone. Out in the wilderness, wild beasts were abundant. For anyone to venture out all by himself was to court death.\nEven Uncle Zhao, Zhao Dahu, famous in Nine Links City, was able to deal with just three wild wolves on his own. Maybe four, at the very most. Any more and even the Nine Links City’s supposedly top-notch expert would have to surrender.\n\"With stuff like martial arts manuals, it’s hard to tell genuine apart from fake. Not only that, many of them have hidden snares within them. Even if they were genuine, some of the methods written inside will lead to lifelong handicaps if you make even a small mistake and practice them for long. What do you want this for, Brother Sheng? Without a master to guide you, there’s no use no matter how many manuals you buy,\" Zheng Xiangui asked out of curiosity, rubbing his white jade thumb ring.\n\"You’re quite in-the-know.\" Lu Sheng chuckled. \"I naturally have my uses for them. Don’t bother yourself with that, just find me a few to begin with.\"\nZheng Xiangui shrugged. \"Well, I guess there are a few. Two martial arts manuals were deposited for sale by a client just recently. We’ve gotten a master to examine them. They should be genuine. But without a master, nobody dares to practice them.\"\n\"What’s the asking price?\" Lu Sheng asked straightforwardly.\n\"Hey hey, Brother Sheng, with this special relationship going on between the two of us, why act so polite?\" Zheng Xiangui started giggling like a woman.\n\"Can you stop being so disgusting?\" Lu Sheng was speechless. \"Name a price, come on, I’m in a hurry.\"\n\"I can only sell you one. The other one has been reserved by another VIP,\" Zheng Xiangui said with a smile.\n\"One will do. Did you bring it?\" Lu Sheng raised his eyes.\n\"Brother Sheng understands me well after all. Seeing how you were going after it, I directly brought it over,\" Zheng Xiangui took out a thin grey booklet.\n\"This manual doesn’t have any moves. It’s simply a special strength technique. One price, a hundred talents!\"\n\"Let me take a look first,\" Lu Sheng stretched out his hand.\nA hundred talents was equivalent to ten thousand dollars. This fatso also really dared to ask.\nFatso chuckled and placed the booklet in his hand. Taking the manual over, Lu Sheng flipped through it and read in detail.\nThis manual seemed like it was part of a larger book from which it was ripped. It so happened to contain some content on strength.\nLooking at its contents, the cultivated strength was termed Jade Force.\nAccording to the manual, full mastery of the skill allowed one to begin accumulating force from all over the body right from the very first move. The accumulated force, once completed, could raise one’s striking speed and strength explosively by a great margin.\nLu Sheng looked at it. Its technique didn’t seem to overlap with the Black Tiger Saber Mantra and so could be stacked with it.\nBut he was not looking for this.\nHe was looking for those inner force Qi skills – manuals which could strengthen his physique and mind.\nFrom the pathetic state he landed himself in after using the Modifier once, he could tell that he needed to improve his physique in order to reduce the aftereffects of using the Modifier.\n\"Do you have those legendary inner force Qi manuals?\"\n\"Inner force Qi manuals?\" Zheng Xiangui rubbed his chin.\n\"Brother Sheng, you got me in a fix now. If there really was such stuff in the market, not to mention whether they’re real or fake, they’d be snatched up in the blink of an eye.\"\n\"You yourself said that it’s hard to distinguish real from fake. You should have copies of such in your family warehouse, right?\"\nLu Sheng, too, was in-the-know. A business like an auction house would certainly make a copy of the manuals they release for auction to keep as surviving copies.\nHaving run an auction house for so many years, the Zheng family must have had accumulated more than a few such copies.\n\"Oh, those… Brother Sheng. Even I cannot guarantee that there’s any one genuine among them.\nIf only one in a hundred is real, we’ll be lucky. Until today, no one has been able to cultivate any Qi from them. You sure you want them?\" Zheng Xiangui hesitated. \"As your brother, I’ll give you a piece of advice: don’t play with those surviving copies. If anything goes awry, you’ll damage your body and there are no means to fix that.\"\n\"You’ve got a way to find them?\"\nLu Sheng raised his brows. Fatso’s expression was a familiar one to him. Each time he displayed such an expression, it meant that he did know an answer, but was hesitating whether or not he should say it.\n\"Well, I’ve got a way… Brother Sheng, the kind of a manual you want… there indeed is one like that in this upcoming auction,\" an awkward expression appeared on Zheng Xiangui’s face.\n\"Why didn’t you say so earlier?\" Lu Sheng’s brows twitched.\n\"It’s not that your brother didn’t want to say. It’s that this stuff is going to be placed on auction in the Black Meeting…\"\n\"Black Meeting?\" Lu Sheng understood instantly.\nA Black Meeting was an anonymous auction during which clients hid their faces and names. The items brought out for auction were also often \"unclean\"; more than one of them was something blood was spilt over as well.\nThose who liked to attend the Black Meeting were mostly those who lived on the edge and were dangerous gangsters.\n\"Can you arrange for me to attend?\" Lu Sheng, however, had made up his mind to attend.\nNo average gangster would dare to provoke the Lu Manor anyway.\nJust counting strong housemen, the Lu family had thirty or forty of them. Not to mention several experts like Uncle Zhao among the ranks of its estate guards.\nOld Master Lu Quanan also possessed inseparable connections with the yamen authorities and could expect the help of the army when he encountered trouble.\nWith a powerful family background like that, he really needed not fear any ordinary gangsters.\n[1] ED/N: The only Chinese subspecies of wolves that would barely fit the bill is the Mongolian wolf, being roughly the same or barely smaller compared to golden retrievers (unless there’s something I missed). Most other wolves like the Tibetan wolf or the wolves in the West are much bigger. Maybe the author meant St. Bernard or a similar dog breed?

In the pugilistic world, it can be considered a third-class martial art. But don’t underestimate it because of that. It’s got its strengths. Third-class secret manuals are good enough to make it into restricted libraries of great sects.\nTake it back and read it seriously, including the detailed posture diagrams. Follow them and practice by yourself for now. If you’re sure that you want to learn this technique after browsing through it, come to me afterwards. But regardless of whether you decide to learn it or not, you must remember to return this booklet to me.\"\nZhao Dahu carefully handed the booklet over to Lu Sheng.\n\"Alright!\" Lu Sheng understood that this likely was Zhao Dahu’s crown jewel.\nWhile he handed it over to him so easily, it by no means implied that Lu Sheng could learn the saber technique simply with the booklet alone.\nTraining in martial arts was highly demanding; it required many corrections of the details. It was not something one could learn easily by following some instructions on a booklet.\n\"Many thanks, Uncle Zhao!\" Lu Sheng received the booklet with great care.\nCarrying the Black Tiger Saber Technique booklet, he went straight back to his bedroom and closed the door. Alone, he lit the candles, flipped open the booklet and started reading its contents.\nBlack Tiger Saber Technique – though it was termed a \"saber technique\", it actually contained only a total of three moves.\nAll three were offensive moves.\nNo defensive moves, no evasion techniques... only offensive moves.\nThe first move – Tiger Kill.\nThe second move – Tiger Might.\nThe third move – Tiger Roar.\nThe moves were simple: they were basically three different saber strokes, each having different strengths and effects.\nLu Sheng looked at it briefly and roughly understood it. Simple as those strokes were, their might depended on one’s familiarity with them as well as one’s strength and speed.\nStrength and speed, in turn, relied on one’s body coordination when employing force.\nHence a mantra came along with those three saber strokes as part of the package.\nThe so-called mantra was essentially a guide to thought and mental activity, applied to daily life, which maximized the power of the saber technique. It was basically what people termed as adjusting the mental world.\nStroke techniques for adjusting The External, mantra for adjusting The Internal: the two combined to achieve the ultimate integration of one’s mind, body and soul.\nThe Black Tiger Mantra was divided into three levels. There were no special names for the levels; they were simply called Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.\nOnly when one mastered the mantra and became familiar with the external stroke techniques as described in the booklet could one be considered as having achieved full mastery of the saber technique.\nLu Sheng closed the booklet lightly and sat by the table in silence for a long while, unceasingly memorizing all the challenging parts of the Black Tiger Saber Technique and revising them over and over again.\nThen, he called out in his mind. \"Deep Blue.\"\nImmediately, the Deep Blue Skills Modifier screen appeared before his eyes.\nEnclosed within the blue-bordered frame were rows after rows of small boxes. The box in the first row of the first column, at this moment, displayed his present status.\nLu Sheng --\nMartial Arts:\nBlack Tiger Saber Technique: Uninitiated.\"\nThe display was very simple and contained only the Black Tiger Saber Technique that he had just browsed through once.\n‘It really… it really wasn’t a hallucination!’ Lu Sheng’s body stiffened immediately.\nNot out of fear, but... out of excitement!\nThis world was way too dangerous.\nHe was originally content to be a parasite, living without care or worry for the rest of his life. But now it felt like he had just fallen into a snake’s den and became surrounded by many poisonous snakes. If he were to accidentally fall prey to one of them, he would instantly become a minor character in some horror myth – dead beyond death. [1]\n‘But now, there’s finally a glimmer of hope… if this modifier really works…’ Lu Sheng suppressed the excitement within his heart and began recalling the cheating device’s functions which he had written into its code.\nThe Deep Blue Skills Modifier had only one function, and that was to modify the martial arts skillset of the main character in the game.\nIt could modify the level of one’s martial arts directly into the pinnacle level of complete mastery. But what it could not do was modify one’s level of familiarity with the martial arts, blood volume, strength, speed, inner force… etc.\nThe only thing it could modify was the level of the martial arts that one was already initiated in.\n‘The only thing I can modify in this box is this Black Tiger Saber Technique. How do I begin the modification?’ Lu Sheng began fiddling around.\nAlone in his bedroom, his hands were subconsciously flipping through the booklet, but his attention was actually focused on the Deep Blue Skills Modifier in his mind.\nHe scrutinized the modifier, over and over again. Quickly, he discovered a tiny button right at the bottom of the modifier.\nOn it was written: Begin Modification.\n‘This is it.’\nWith a thought, he pressed deeply onto the button, as if with a finger.\nImmediately, the entire screen flashed, and he suddenly felt that he could control everything in the Modifier at will.\nIt was a miraculous feeling. But rather than dwelling on it, Lu Sheng’s attention quickly focused entirely on the Black Tiger Saber Technique.\nThe status display after the Black Tiger Saber Technique read \"Uninitiated\". But in that very moment, when he focused his attention on it, its status jumped in a flash. It turned into \"Initiated\".\nDelighted, Lu Sheng eagerly focused his attention on Black Tiger Saber Technique.\nVery swiftly, the Black Tiger Saber Technique jumped again and turned into Level 1.\nAfter that was Level 2, Level 3…\n\"It’s done!\" Lu Sheng was filled with delight. Looks like the modifier worked indeed.\nBut, just as he was ready to kick back and relax, the Black Tiger Saber Technique jumped again!\n\"Level 4!!\"\nThe Black Tiger Saber Technique jumped to Level 4 in one sitting!\n\"Boom!\"\nJust as the Black Tiger Saber Technique advanced to Level 4, Lu Sheng felt a loud boom go off in his mind.\nA splitting headache came upon him and his body began trembling violently as if he was struck by lightning.\nHe collapsed onto the table. After a long period of recovery, he finally lifted his head with difficulty.\nIt felt wet beneath his nose, and he sniffed out a hint of blood’s smell.\nLu Sheng lifted his hand and gently rubbed on it. It was dark-red blood.\nHis eyes were unfocused and every single spot all over his body was sore. His body felt devoid of any strength; even standing up took a great deal of effort from him.\nLifting his arms, he saw a terrible-looking patch of white on the skin at the back of his palms. He couldn’t keep his eyes open and felt extremely sleepy.\n‘These are symptoms of a serious blood loss!’ Though Lu Sheng did not have medical training, he at least possessed some basic common knowledge... enough to know that he might be suffering from a serious blood loss.\nSitting by the table, he just barely propped himself up and kept the booklet. Then he collapsed onto the bed to rest.\n\"Little Qiao!\"\n\"Yes, Young Master? What are your instructions?\" Little Qiao asked softly outside the door.\n\"Go… cook me some red dates porridge and add some ginseng into it. Use an aged one,\" Lu Sheng said with great difficulty.\nThat was the good thing about being a rich man’s kid. Average families treated normal ginseng as a life-saver, not to mention aged ginseng. Which family could eat it as a tonic like Lu Sheng was about to do?\nLittle Qiao acknowledged and quickly ran to the kitchen to relay his instructions to the cooks.\nLying alone on the bed, Lu Sheng rested for a long while, but his vision remained somewhat dark and he felt devoid of strength in his limbs.\nYet, ignoring these sensations, he stretched out his arm and, to his surprise, a practiced muscle memory and intuition that was the result of years of familiarity and practice with saber flooded from his palms into his mind.\nThe three moves of the Black Tiger Saber Technique and the three levels of its mantra had unknowingly become etched indelibly onto his mind.\nHe now thoroughly comprehended the three stroke moves, even the hidden subtleties behind them. Not only that, he also understood inside out how the mantra complemented the different strokes.\n\"It really worked!?\" Lu Sheng closed his eyes, his heart in ecstasy.\nThe experiment had succeeded.\nAlthough it had consumed his blood and mental energy, it was worth it in exchange for the full mastery of the Black Tiger Saber Technique.\n‘But, the Black Tiger Saber Technique clearly has only three levels. So where did this fourth level come from?’ That was what baffled Lu Sheng.\nMoreover, the fourth level of the Black Tiger Saber Technique now felt extremely familiar to him in his mind.\nIt was as if… as if he created it personally in the first place!\nThe subtle philosophy and ideological underpinnings hidden within it were not something that a person of this world could conjure up, rather, it seemed to be the product of modern scientific theories of force.\nAlthough he was just a civil servant, he had at least taken classes on engineering, sports, science and the likes.\nBefore he could continue that line of thought, Little Qiao brought the porridge over.\n\"Coincidentally, some blood-restoring porridge was cooked for Third Young Miss, also with red dates as its main ingredient. But Third Young Miss doesn’t want it, so I brought it over for Young Master. This is Lily Red Dates Broth, good for calming the mind and restoring blood. I’ve also added ginseng into it. Do you want it, Young Master?\" Little Qiao asked softly outside the door.\n\"Bring it in,\" Lu Sheng replied softly.\nLittle Qiao gently pushed open the doors and walked in. But immediately upon entering, she saw the trace of blood on Lu Sheng’s collar.\n\"Mas…Mas…Mas… Young Master, what happened to you!!?\" Little Qiao was so shocked she almost spilled the porridge on the floor.\nLu Sheng grimaced.\n\"I’m fine.\"\n\"You still say you’re fine! You’ve even vomited blood!\" Xiao Qiao’s face had turned pale with fright.\n\"I really am fine…\" Lu Sheng replied helplessly.\nLittle Qiao hurried to serve Lu Sheng the bowl of porridge in her hands. \"Come Young Master, drink some hot porridge first.\"\nWith her assistance, Lu Sheng finished the entire bowl of porridge, one mouthful at a time.\nHaving finished eating, he felt more at ease.\nHe began to recall in detail all of the assorted pieces of information and experience pertaining to the Black Tiger Saber Technique that had suddenly popped up in his mind.\nStrangely, these were stored in his mind as if they were there right from the beginning. There was no difficulty involved in comprehending them and he felt as if it would be a piece of cake for him to execute them in practice.\nIf not for the current state of his body, he would have searched for a saber in the arena and begun practising.\nAfter he had finished the porridge, Little Qiao quickly left for the pharmacy to look for the Lu Manor’s doctor-in-residence. She was still worrying about Lu Sheng’s health.\nLu Manor possessed its own exclusive doctor – a thin elderly man sporting a goatee.\nCarrying a giant medicinal chest on his back, he hurried over.\nHe sat down beside Lu Sheng’s bed and touched his pulse. After that, his brows unknotted themselves.\n\"It’s nothing much, just a loss of blood. Also, too much mental energy had been expended. He just needs to rest for a few days,\" he pulled out a slip of paper and began scribbling a tonic prescription on it.\n\"Take this to the pharmacy, and feed the Young Master with it twice a day for ten days and he’ll fully recover.\"\n\"Thank you, doctor.\"\nLu Sheng heaved a sigh of relief. It was exactly the same as his own diagnosis.\nNot long later, Lu Fang aka Lu Quanan also arrived.\n\"What happened?\" He had come with his second and third mother. [2]\nLu Sheng’s own mother had died of sickness a long time ago. It was his second mother who raised him.\nHis second mother Liu Cuiyu was mild-mannered and treated others with great generosity. She raised him like her own child, without any differential treatment between him and her own children.\n\"It’s just some blood loss from practicing martial arts. It’s nothing,\" one by one, Lu Sheng explained to his family members.\nAs the eldest son of the family, he was to inherit the family’s enterprise in the future and become its central pillar. Anything that happened to him would naturally immediately draw other’s concern.\n[1] ED/N: Literally rice weevil, figuratively sponger, parasite.\n[2] ED/N: The author literally seems to be saying second and third mothers… I’d rather use \"wives\" but it’d sound even more awkward later, so... Well, taking into account that it’s a different world, I guess it’s okay to allow the author some leeway for differences in common sense there (if it’s intentional, that is…)."}]}
