Borrowing the momentum from the huge impact, the long-hilted saber swept away the oncoming black shadow.\n\"BAM!\"\nThe black shadow slammed into the ground, rolled over a few times and emitted a pained growl. The torch cast its light onto it now that it appeared in its range.\nIt was a wild wolf! Its waist had been cut wide open by his saber!\nBefore he could think about it further, two other wild wolves pounced towards him from the dark.\nHis body reacted in the first second by instinct.\nTilting the long-hilted saber leftwards, he blocked one of the wild wolves with its long hilt. Then, with a swing of his body, he threw that wolf onto the other beast.\n\"Bang!\"\nThese two effortful motions left him wanting in strength. He was but a frail and skinny rich man’s kid not too long ago, after all.\nThe two wild wolves were thrown into the distance, hurt.\nPanting heavily and red-eyed, Lu Sheng lifted his saber and unleashed a Tiger Kill on the nearest wild wolf!\nThe blade sliced down from above, inclining slightly. His wrists vibrated vigorously – they shook thrice continuously, as per the rate dictated by the mantra.\n\"Whoosh!\"\nThe roar of a fierce tiger seemed to ring in the air.\nStruck with fear, the two wild wolves trembled and their movements lapsed by a beat.\nAt that instant, light flashed across the blade of the long-hilted saber. One of the beasts was beheaded on the spot with a clean saber stroke.\nThe tip of the saber had also nicked the other wolf’s neck, and blood was rapidly seeping out of it.\nLu Sheng mustered up his strength and struck again. This time, it was Tiger Might.\nHis forearm vibrated four times, employing a different level of force each time. The strength of his entire body was channeled into the saber.\nTiger Might emphasized speed more than Tiger Kill did, compromising slightly on strength in return. Nonetheless, it wasn’t something the fragile neck of a mere wild wolf could withstand.\nBefore the wolf could dodge, it was struck squarely in the neck by the long-hilted saber that sped up drastically without warning.\n\"Splat!\"\nThe wolf’s head fell on the ground.\nLu Sheng sucked in huge mouthfuls of air, panting heavily.\nThe continuous series of big movements had left a layer of sweat on his face.\n\"HOWL…\"\nOne more wild wolf remained – the one which went for the meat.\nNow, it went around a rock, its two green eyes staring furiously at Lu Sheng.\n‘My body’s too weak after all…’ Frustration gathered in Lu Sheng’s heart.\nHowever, his face remained impassive. He understood that when facing off against a wild beast, one must never back off or show even a hint of fear.\n\"Eh!?\"\nBoth his eyes opened wide in a stare as he glared fiercely at the wolf.\nThe last wild wolf focused its stare on him for a moment longer before slowly retreating backwards. Finally, it completely slipped into the darkness.\nOnly then did Lu Sheng breathe in relief.\nActually, his stamina was almost completely spent. Both his arms were sore and weak, even to the point of trembling when grasping his saber.\nIf that wild wolf had really pounced on him... while he was certain that he would survive, he wouldn’t remain unscathed either.\nHe waited till he was sure that the wild wolf had really left. Then, Lu Sheng retrieved the torch and left hurriedly in the direction of Nine Links City.\nWith this trip, he now knew where he stood.\nUncle Zhao had once mentioned his glorious past in connection with the wild wolves outside the city.\nAfter achieving full mastery of his saberplay in his youth, he had once been surrounded and attacked by three wild wolves. Armed with nothing but a single-handed saber, he slaughtered all three wolves at the cost of a mild injury to his forearm.\nThis had already set a terrific battle score.\nThe wild wolves in this world were completely different from those that Lu Sheng knew.\nTheir bodies were larger – each one much larger than the wild wolves on Earth. They were much stronger as well.\nAlmost the same as the big golden retrievers people kept as pets. [1]\nAnother difference between wild wolves here and on Earth was that those here gathered in packs of three to five. Very rarely would there be large packs of them.\nLu Sheng jogged back to the city gates. When the light of the torches on the city walls came into view, he felt a sense of relief.\nRolling up the clothes on him, he hid the blood-stained spots and his long-hilted sabre, took out his travel pass, and strode towards the city gates.\n***\n\"Brother Sheng, Brother Sheng, listen to me! This ain’t ordinary stuff. Right after reaching Zi Hua City, I had people bring it here from over there.\nRumor has it that in the Central Plains it is considered the Number One Legendary Stone. Countless merchants and nobles bid and fought for it. Finally, in an accident, it fell into the river and the waves brought it to Zi Hua River. Then it was fished out of the waters by the fishermen of Zi Hua City.\nI can’t tell you the twists and turns of this story in just a few words. If not for…\"\n\"Do I look like a fool to you?\" Lu Sheng gently waved his fan and looked at a fatso before him with a faint smile.\nThis fatso was called Zheng Xiangui. He was the second son of the boss of the Precious & Famous Auction House in Nine Links City.\nAs well as Lu Sheng’s best friend from his past.\nLu Sheng and he grew up as brothers from another mother. They clicked impeccably with each other and went through all troubles together, sharing thick and thin. [2]\nIt’s just that Zheng Xiangui had a bad habit. It was his tendency to wallow in greed.\nIn his own words, he would say that even biological brothers had to keep clear scores, otherwise their relationship would sour sooner or later.\nBoth of them were sitting in Goldfish Restaurant’s Peony Room. A well-endowed lady dressed in pink sat beside the fatso, reclining in his arms.\nThis lad was now staring at Lu Sheng with a pained expression.\n\"Brother Sheng, now that’s where you’re wrong. Your brother here took great pains to find a rare treasure. And now here he is, giving you the opportunity to bid for it in private before it gets auctioned. It’s fine if you don’t value it, but how can you ridicule me?\" Fatso pointed at Lu Sheng, looking as if he was immensely grieved.\n\"Alright, alright. Don’t pull that trick on me. Have you gotten news about the martial arts manuals I’m looking for?\" Lu Sheng continued to ask.\nHe came looking for this blood brother of his in order to gather more martial arts manuals.\nOne Black Tiger Saber Technique was not enough. Not even close.\nHe finally understood the chances of survival out in the wild an expert like Uncle Zhao had.\nNo wonder he had never heard of anyone journeying out in the distance alone. Out in the wilderness, wild beasts were abundant. For anyone to venture out all by himself was to court death.\nEven Uncle Zhao, Zhao Dahu, famous in Nine Links City, was able to deal with just three wild wolves on his own. Maybe four, at the very most. Any more and even the Nine Links City’s supposedly top-notch expert would have to surrender.\n\"With stuff like martial arts manuals, it’s hard to tell genuine apart from fake. Not only that, many of them have hidden snares within them. Even if they were genuine, some of the methods written inside will lead to lifelong handicaps if you make even a small mistake and practice them for long. What do you want this for, Brother Sheng? Without a master to guide you, there’s no use no matter how many manuals you buy,\" Zheng Xiangui asked out of curiosity, rubbing his white jade thumb ring.\n\"You’re quite in-the-know.\" Lu Sheng chuckled. \"I naturally have my uses for them. Don’t bother yourself with that, just find me a few to begin with.\"\nZheng Xiangui shrugged. \"Well, I guess there are a few. Two martial arts manuals were deposited for sale by a client just recently. We’ve gotten a master to examine them. They should be genuine. But without a master, nobody dares to practice them.\"\n\"What’s the asking price?\" Lu Sheng asked straightforwardly.\n\"Hey hey, Brother Sheng, with this special relationship going on between the two of us, why act so polite?\" Zheng Xiangui started giggling like a woman.\n\"Can you stop being so disgusting?\" Lu Sheng was speechless. \"Name a price, come on, I’m in a hurry.\"\n\"I can only sell you one. The other one has been reserved by another VIP,\" Zheng Xiangui said with a smile.\n\"One will do. Did you bring it?\" Lu Sheng raised his eyes.\n\"Brother Sheng understands me well after all. Seeing how you were going after it, I directly brought it over,\" Zheng Xiangui took out a thin grey booklet.\n\"This manual doesn’t have any moves. It’s simply a special strength technique. One price, a hundred talents!\"\n\"Let me take a look first,\" Lu Sheng stretched out his hand.\nA hundred talents was equivalent to ten thousand dollars. This fatso also really dared to ask.\nFatso chuckled and placed the booklet in his hand. Taking the manual over, Lu Sheng flipped through it and read in detail.\nThis manual seemed like it was part of a larger book from which it was ripped. It so happened to contain some content on strength.\nLooking at its contents, the cultivated strength was termed Jade Force.\nAccording to the manual, full mastery of the skill allowed one to begin accumulating force from all over the body right from the very first move. The accumulated force, once completed, could raise one’s striking speed and strength explosively by a great margin.\nLu Sheng looked at it. Its technique didn’t seem to overlap with the Black Tiger Saber Mantra and so could be stacked with it.\nBut he was not looking for this.\nHe was looking for those inner force Qi skills – manuals which could strengthen his physique and mind.\nFrom the pathetic state he landed himself in after using the Modifier once, he could tell that he needed to improve his physique in order to reduce the aftereffects of using the Modifier.\n\"Do you have those legendary inner force Qi manuals?\"\n\"Inner force Qi manuals?\" Zheng Xiangui rubbed his chin.\n\"Brother Sheng, you got me in a fix now. If there really was such stuff in the market, not to mention whether they’re real or fake, they’d be snatched up in the blink of an eye.\"\n\"You yourself said that it’s hard to distinguish real from fake. You should have copies of such in your family warehouse, right?\"\nLu Sheng, too, was in-the-know. A business like an auction house would certainly make a copy of the manuals they release for auction to keep as surviving copies.\nHaving run an auction house for so many years, the Zheng family must have had accumulated more than a few such copies.\n\"Oh, those… Brother Sheng. Even I cannot guarantee that there’s any one genuine among them.\nIf only one in a hundred is real, we’ll be lucky. Until today, no one has been able to cultivate any Qi from them. You sure you want them?\" Zheng Xiangui hesitated. \"As your brother, I’ll give you a piece of advice: don’t play with those surviving copies. If anything goes awry, you’ll damage your body and there are no means to fix that.\"\n\"You’ve got a way to find them?\"\nLu Sheng raised his brows. Fatso’s expression was a familiar one to him. Each time he displayed such an expression, it meant that he did know an answer, but was hesitating whether or not he should say it.\n\"Well, I’ve got a way… Brother Sheng, the kind of a manual you want… there indeed is one like that in this upcoming auction,\" an awkward expression appeared on Zheng Xiangui’s face.\n\"Why didn’t you say so earlier?\" Lu Sheng’s brows twitched.\n\"It’s not that your brother didn’t want to say. It’s that this stuff is going to be placed on auction in the Black Meeting…\"\n\"Black Meeting?\" Lu Sheng understood instantly.\nA Black Meeting was an anonymous auction during which clients hid their faces and names. The items brought out for auction were also often \"unclean\"; more than one of them was something blood was spilt over as well.\nThose who liked to attend the Black Meeting were mostly those who lived on the edge and were dangerous gangsters.\n\"Can you arrange for me to attend?\" Lu Sheng, however, had made up his mind to attend.\nNo average gangster would dare to provoke the Lu Manor anyway.\nJust counting strong housemen, the Lu family had thirty or forty of them. Not to mention several experts like Uncle Zhao among the ranks of its estate guards.\nOld Master Lu Quanan also possessed inseparable connections with the yamen authorities and could expect the help of the army when he encountered trouble.\nWith a powerful family background like that, he really needed not fear any ordinary gangsters.\n[1] ED/N: The only Chinese subspecies of wolves that would barely fit the bill is the Mongolian wolf, being roughly the same or barely smaller compared to golden retrievers (unless there’s something I missed). Most other wolves like the Tibetan wolf or the wolves in the West are much bigger. Maybe the author meant St. Bernard or a similar dog breed?

Yesterday, Old Master called all heads of the businesses here, both minor and major, for a meeting. As they were leaving, I heard them say that everyone will have to help find it together. I wonder what it is, to go so far as to call all those big shots to help,\" Little Eight smiled as he thought about the matter.\nLu Sheng said nothing in response. However, he put on a rather gloomy expression. He walked past the main door to enter inside. As he walked, he asked him another question. \"Has anything strange happened lately?\"\n\"Er… Young Master, although Little Eight is considered well-informed, how can strange things happen everyday?\" Little Eight shrugged his shoulders helplessly. [1]\n\"Although… I heard that there was a big fire that broke out last night at the Goldfish Restaurant that you frequent. Half the side street was burnt away! Even though we servants were a long way off, we could still see the flames very distinctly from far away.\"\n\"A big fire…\"\nLu Sheng’s heart sank. He had a faint guess.\n\"Are you talking about that street that often sells cosmetic powders during the day?\"\n\"Precisely, just that!\" Little Eight nodded vigorously, \"I hear that quite a number of people died. Some of them were entire families, including the young and the old. It’s really awful… I wonder which heartless creature set the fire!\"\n‘A big fire…’\nLu Sheng said nothing more. He suppressed the matter deep within his heart and stopped thinking about it.\nThe Black Meeting was arranged to be at night in three days’ time, in a cellar outside the city.\nIn these three days, Lu Sheng rested and ate each day as usual. He could clearly feel his body growing sturdier, as if the Black Tiger Saber altered by the Modifier had also improved his physical state itself.\nIn those three days, he paid the street near Goldfish Restaurant a visit yet again. Sure enough, it was all charred and burnt. Quite a few people could be even seen being busy at rebuilding new houses.\nLu Sheng walked back along the road that he had gone before. It was exactly the same as he had seen the other day.\nEven that dead end of a back alley was just as it had been.\nHe now had a few guesses in mind, but did not feel fearful or anxious.\nSince there were water ghosts in this world, then naturally, other things could also exist.\nHe had initially intended to get initiated in that Jade Force on the ripped manual which he had bought during these three days, and then to modify it. However, as he thought of the Black Meeting, he decided to hold back for now. If he injured himself badly and spat out blood after modification again, he would lose this opportunity.\nTime passed by quickly. In the blink of an eye, it was the day of the appointment.\nIt was around seven or eight at night.\nLu Sheng changed into a set of black robes and put on the mask of a tiger. It was a toy for children that he had casually bought off the streets, and was very crudely made.\nIn front of the Lu Manor entrance, the Zheng Family’s horse carriage was already waiting.\nHe hurriedly boarded the horse carriage. Zheng Xiangui was currently sitting inside, biting off big chunks of meat from the braised chicken thigh he held in both his hands.\nThis fatso also wore a set of black robes. However, it didn't really matter – anyone could tell from his exaggerated physique that this guy was the Young Master of the faction hosting the Black Meeting.\n\"Good, you’re here, we’re just waiting for you. Brother Sheng, hurry, get on the carriage.\"\nBoth men sat down and the horse carriage slowly began to move.\nZheng Xiangui advised Lu Sheng throughout the journey on the dos and don’ts after entry, a whole host of messy details to pay attention to. Still, Lu Sheng committed each of them to his memory.\nSoon, they left the city. They travelled along a main road, from which they took a twist into a side road, then meandered along for quite a distance before heading directly into the outskirts.\nAfter travelling along the outskirts for a while, the horse carriage approached a little village tucked away in an overgrown wilderness area. It stopped in front of a stone house in the middle of the village.\n\"This is it,\" Zheng Xiangui jumped off the carriage. A black-robed man standing guard at the door of the stone house came forward and greeted him.\n\"Everybody’s present?\"\n\"Everybody’s present. The first auction item is already being displayed.\"\nZheng Xiangui nodded, anxiously urging, \"Let’s hurry inside, it’s already started.\"\nHe pulled Lu Sheng into the stone house. He opened a wooden door on the floor in the middle of the stone house, revealing a flight of stairs that led underground.\nLu Sheng followed behind Zheng Xiangui and two other guards down the stairs. At the bottom was a karst cave with a rather large surface area.\nThe karst cave was even prepared rather decently.\nThere was a big hall in the middle. In the surrounding stone walls was a circle of side rooms, each of them looking like little packets hanging on the walls.\nA few people were seated sparsely in the big hall. No firelight came from the surrounding little packets; clearly, they were not in use.\n\"Wow, this place has a rather huge layout,\" Lu Sheng exclaimed.\n\"Hehe, we discovered this place accidentally,\" the fatso said laughingly. He brought Lu Sheng in from the back of the big hall, and headed for the seats in the front row.\nOnly a little more than ten people in total attended the Black Meeting this time. They all sat scattered around the first row.\nA tall, skinny man whose face was veiled was standing on the stage. Currently, he was introducing the details of the item being auctioned in a loud voice.\nNext to him stood two dwarves. Both of them wore bright garish floral garments and held a bronze plate in their hands between them. There was a dagger on the plate, brown and spotty from rust.\n\"An ancient dagger passed down from Ju Rong Nation, most likely forged by Duan Fengzi of the olden days! There are some words carved on it in the national language of Ju Rong Nation, even if… aye! Guest No. Four bids one thousand talents! Any higher bids? Any higher bids!?\" The man on the stage yelled loudly with an extremely animated expression.\nLu Sheng and Zheng Xiangui sat on the seats to the left.\nThe rows of seats here all seemed to be carved out of white stone. It was extremely cold to the touch, emitting completely no warmth.\nFatso sat right next to him. He cocked his head and whispered, \"What you want is the fifth item, the second to last one.\"\nLu Sheng nodded his head wordlessly.\nClearly, the dagger on the stage had just been dug up from the ground not too long ago. It was perhaps found by a grave robber.\nThere were still quite a few people competing for it below. In just a short while, the bid for the dagger had risen to one thousand eight hundred talents.\nLu Sheng’s heart beat quickly as he listened to the proceedings. This was already twice the equivalent of his monthly allowance!\nHe did not watch the bidding competition on stage any longer. Instead, he diverted his attention to focus on the guests who were near him.\nMost of the guests to the Black Meeting carried with them weapons, ranging from short to long in size. Moreover, most of them were dressed in black and disguised, though there were also exceptions.\nOf the more than ten guests who were present, there were three who did not conceal their identity.\nOne of them was a man with red hair who wore a fitting yellow leather armor and carried a broadsword on his back.\nAnother was a very short, skinny and seemingly weak youth who had a beak-like mouth and sunken cheeks. Tied to his waist were two bulging black leather pouches that carried god-knew-what.\nThe third one was the most eye-catching.\nOr rather, it was a pair. A man and a woman.\nThe man’s clothes and a sword he carried on his waist conveyed a sense of strength; he seemed to be a bodyguard. He held an indifferent look that only softened for a bit when he gazed upon the woman.\nThe woman wore a black dress that was not one of the typical long dresses that women in ancient times wore. It was a tight dress whose hem and its surroundings looked like a body-hugging miniskirt that one would see on Earth.\nFrom head to toe, there was only that one piece body-hugging dress which barely covered her rear. Just a slightly bigger movement of lifting her legs would clearly reveal the space between her two legs.\nThis woman dressed sexily. She had long legs and a slender waist; a pair of white weapons at her chest threatened to tear the dress apart, looking as if at any moment the dress would burst at the seams near the chest area.\nLu Sheng could not help but look at the woman’s face.\nShe had a very high nose bridge and a pair of charming and glittering eyes that seemed to always be smiling. Her long black hair fell on her shoulders, so smooth and shining that they seemed to reflect a bit of light.\n‘This is so much more effective than any so-called Photoshop makeup technique,’ Lu Sheng praised in his heart.\nOne could tell that this woman was someone influential with a mere glance. Only one who was absolutely confident in one’s strength would dare to show such a beautiful face so freely at the Black Meeting.\n\"That’s Duan Muwan,\" seeing Lu Sheng’s attention had been attracted by the woman, Fatso promptly leaned in to whisper the introduction. \"But I don't recommend you trying to pick her up. This woman is beyond fierce!\"\n\"Fierce? How so?\"\nLu Sheng was mildly curious, but he did not have any designs on her. It was just that the woman was simply too eye-catching, so he was sizing her up.\nFatty smiled a little and looked towards the stage, at the second auction item that had already appeared.\n\"Duan Muwan came to Nine Links City about two months ago. I heard that she came along with a merchant group. The two of them, master and servant, joined the group by themselves. To walk such a long distance in itself is already not easy.\"\n\"Indeed, it’s no easy feat,\" Lu Sheng nodded.\n\"Moreover, because of her natural beauty, this woman has been very promiscuous since coming to Nine Links City. Quite a number of handsome young masters have been seduced by her and then, guess what happened?\" Fatso shook his head and sighed.\n\"What?\" Lu Sheng asked, his curiosity now piqued.\n\"All the young masters were infatuated beyond reason, resulting in a massive melee, which resulted in quite a number of injured and even quite a few killed,\" fatso said as he clicked his tongue.\n\"Even so, those who were seriously injured and handicapped remain devoted to this woman. But she’s already forgotten them in the blink of an eye!\"\nLu Sheng narrowed his eyes, a shiver in his heart. He had heard of these incidents, but never imagined that this woman was the cause of them all. For them to pine for her even after they were handicapped… this was not something that could be explained by her beauty.\nIn that moment, he labeled Duan Muwan as extremely dangerous in his mind. For her to be able to twist so many people around her little finger, she either had extremely high EQ or employed some unusual methods. It was best to stay as far away as possible from such characters.\nHe refocused his attention on the auction on the stage.\nIt was already the fourth auction item’s turn now: a yellow-bronze half-body leather armor.\n\"This leather armor is the Ice Wolf Armor, made of the combined, tanned hide of nineteen white wolves of the Ice White Grasslands. Nineteen layers of wolf hide are now as thin as a copper coin after tanning. Its resistance against both blunt tools and swords far exceeds that of a normal leather armor. It’s almost the same as wearing another layer of chainmail armor!\" The black-robed man exclaimed loudly to introduce this piece of leather armor.\n\"Starting bid price is two hundred talents!\"\nSilence. No one moved.\nThe host didn't seem to mind it very much. He got one of the dwarves to hold the leather armor before personally taking out a dagger and violently piercing into its side.\n\"Thud!\"\nA muffled sound rang out as the dagger slid off. Surprisingly, only a small scratch remained on the leather armor.\n\"Three hundred talents!\" Seeing that, someone immediately placed a bid.\n\"Four hundred talents!\"\n\"Six hundred talents!\"\nThe bids continued to rise higher and higher. Lu Sheng himself was rather moved when he saw it. This sort of leather armor was both lightweight and nimble, and was more convenient and flexible than the metal armor as it did not affect one’s movements. If its defense was really as strong as stated, then it indeed was a valuable item.\nHe wanted to state a price, but seeing that the bids arrived at almost one thousand talents in the blink of an eye, he could only restrain himself and give it up. His true goal was still the next item: the manual.\nHe could not lose sight of the big picture for this small item.\nIn the end, the leather armor was bought by the red-haired man with the broadsword on his back. Shortly afterwards, the second last item was up.\nThe inner force secret manual."}]}
