This time, he went there when it was still day.\nSaber in hand, he searched around the entire room wordlessly.\nThen, after he had committed the shape and size of the room as well as the position of all the items within to his memory, he once again sat down inside.\nHe calmly waited for the dusk to fall.\nThe Lu Manor had been temporarily subdued by him, with none daring to entertain the thought of fleeing.\nAfter all, Nine Links City was only this big. Their only option would be to escape to Zi Hua City. However, with everyone else on high alert, monitoring the situation, none dared to be the first to try anything funny.\nThey were all afraid that someone else would secretly blow the whistle on them in front of Young Master—Lu Sheng had established that whoever reported a deserter would be awarded a hundred talents for each person reported!\nA hundred talents! If one reported ten people, that would be one thousand talents!\nNot many people would be able to earn such a vast sum, not even across their entire lives.\nThus, for the time being, the situation in the Lu Manor was stabilized.\nEldest Uncle had also deployed some soldiers to stand guard at each of the entrances of the Lu Manor, restricting anyone from leaving as they deemed fit.\nAs for those who had escaped earlier, he also put up wanted posters in order to catch and bring them all back.\nAfter all that spate of busyness, the sky gradually dimmed.\n\"HOO…\"\nStreams of air constantly circulated inside the house.\nLu Sheng sat within Sister Yu’s room, his hand gripping an unsheathed saber. His eyes were closed as if he were taking forty winks.\nHe had not rested the entire last night. As he waited here during the day, it was also in this manner that he sat down to rest.\nJade Crane Skill was indeed formidable. Even though he had not slept the whole night, he remained rather energetic.\nThe rays from the sun slowly faded.\nLu Sheng did not light the room. He sat there in the gloomy darkness, intending to completely recreate the usual conditions of the room.\nLight faded gradually as the place became darker and darker.\nLu Sheng slowly adjusted by relying on his sense of hearing and paying attention to the movement of the air currents to observe his surroundings.\nTime trickled away in minutes and seconds.\nSoon, the sun had fully set and the room was cast in absolute pitch darkness. He could not even see his fingers stretched out in front of him.\nNonetheless, Lu Sheng remained sitting there, stable as a rock.\n\"Swish…\"\nSuddenly, the sound of clothes ruffling against each other drifted in from the door.\nIt sounded like the faint swish of clothes, seemingly rubbing against the wooden surface of the wall.\nLu Sheng opened his eyes. A faintly discernible blur of white shadow of a person could be seen in the dark, currently climbing in from the door.\nBecause it was simply too dark, he could not see the features of the other party in detail. Only the fuzzy outline of a person clad in white could be seen.\nThis person walked extremely slowly, at the speed of a crawl.\nIn the dark, Lu Sheng felt as if the other party was smiling. He clearly could not see the facial features, but he could feel that the other party was smiling eerily.\n\"You finally dare show yourself.\"\nLu Sheng stood up, both his eyes glowing ferociously.\nBlack Fury Skill instantly circulated through his entire body; his body temperature shot up in an instant.\n\"HOO!\"\nSuddenly, the white shadow flung itself violently at him!\n\"DIEEE!!\"\nA glint flashed from the blade in Lu Sheng’s hands.\nBlack Tiger Saber’s Tiger Might viciously slashed outwards to meet the incoming white shadow!\nIn that moment, as the saber blade collided with the white shadow, his vision blurred and the whole room instantly became silent. There was nothing within earshot.\nCurrently, the space in front of him was completely empty, with nothing in sight. His stroke had actually cut empty air!\n‘Such great speed!’\nWithout even thinking, Lu Sheng swung his long saber around him, viciously hacking at his surroundings maniacally.\n\"CHI!\"\nThe wooden clothes-rack that had been in the way was slashed in a single stroke, falling to the ground. The back of a chair was also split into two in a similar manner.\nHe gave a cold snort, about to keep his saber and continue observing.\nSuddenly, he felt a cold sensation at the back of his head.\nLu Sheng swung around madly. Unexpectedly, the white-robed figure was just a hair’s breadth right behind him, hurling itself towards him.\n\"You court death!!\"\nBlack Fury Skill mobilized at its highest capacity all over his body. Qi and blood pulsed wildly through him as his long saber abruptly unleashed the third move of Black Tiger Saber—Tiger Roar.\n\"ROAR!!!\"\nAs the full might of Black Fury Skill rushed through him, the saber blade even clearly emitted the deafening, ear-splitting roar of a tiger.\nThe tiger roar shook all the items within the house, causing them to tremble and jiggle about.\nAt once, that white shadow gave a miserable shriek similar to the shrill cry of a little girl. With a whoosh, it fled from the window.\nNot hesitating for even a moment, Lu Sheng calmed his raging Qi and blood as he sped off in pursuit.\n\"BANG!\"\nIn a stroke, he whacked the wooden window that was in his way, destroying it.\nHis whole person seemed like a ferocious tiger emerging from its lair as he jumped out of the window into the alley.\nThe white shadow moved at astonishing speed. With just a few twists and turns, it zoomed down the alley, past the junk that littered the place.\nLu Sheng was in hot pursuit.\n\"Bam! Bam!!!\"\nTwo piles of junk that were in his way immediately exploded under his two strokes.\n\"There’s some commotion inside! Is it Young Master?\"\nSome guards outside were shouting.\nLu sheng’s heart constricted.\nThen, he saw some guards on the night watch near the side door.\nOne of them turned to look in his direction, his face taut with fear as he held onto a saber.\nLu Sheng didn't even have time to say anything. The white shadow sped forward with terrifying speed and entered the body of one of the guards.\n\"ALL DISPERSE!\" He thundered in rage. The mad rush of his Qi and blood once again caused his saber blade to emit a sound like the immense roar of a massive tiger.\n\"HOWL!\"\nLu Sheng’s entire person pounced forward forcefully, slashing out with Tiger Roar!\n\"DANG!\"\nVeins rapidly surfaced all over the skin of the guard whose body the white shadow had entered. He raised his hand to dodge the attack.\nStartlingly, he was actually able to precisely block Lu Sheng’s saber move.\nTwo blades collided at full impact. In that instant, Lu Sheng felt strength not inferior to that of his own resist him furiously.\nLooking at the guard again, he saw that both his eyes had already rolled back. Both eyes were without any black, leaving behind but a patch of miserable white.\n‘Possession?’\nLu Sheng extended his saber once again, heading straight for the guard’s neck.\n\"DANG!\"\nAgain, he was blocked.\nThe guard who had been possessed had drastically grown in might. Lu Sheng traded blows with him with his saber.\nBoth men dueled back and forth with their sabers, causing a cacophony of clanging sounds as metal hit against each other. It was a deafening din.\nThe other two guards at the side door were scared beyond their wits, hurriedly fleeing far away with tails between their legs.\nThe din and commotion attracted the attention of quite a number of other guards and servants, who rushed over.\nUnder the rush of the Black Fury Qi, Lu Sheng’s strength grew by an entire measure as he continued to duel with the possessed guard for over ten moves.\nGradually, the poison from the Black Fury Skill slowly permeated the guard’s palms, causing his strength to steadily decrease and weaken.\nThe second level of Black Fury Skill was indeed as powerful as Lu Sheng had expected, poisonous beyond comparison.\n\"SPEAK! WHO SENT YOU?\" Lu Sheng charged forth brutally in a swift saber attack, hacking into the guard’s saber blade.\nA massive wave of strength thundered through the possessed guard’s body, making it shake violently. His body turned limp and numb in an instant, causing his movements to slow by a beat.\n\"BANG!\"\nLu Sheng’s other hand attacked with a penetrating palm strike to the heart, exploiting the opening to land a blow straight to the guard’s chest.\nHe had long prepared to strike with Heart-Shattering Palm as a premeditated follow-up move.\n\"AH!!!\"\nThe guard shrieked miserably as the attack landed smack on his chest. A mouthful of blood gushed out madly from his mouth as his body was thrown up into the air before falling onto the ground in a heap.\nA flash of white shadow flew out from the guard’s body towards the nearest of those who had come to check out the situation.\nThis time round, it was actually a servant girl.\nPerhaps because the shadow was far too near Lu Sheng, it had no other choice, being able to only choose somebody to enter at random.\nThe servant girl had only just been possessed, her skin turning red, when Lu Sheng rushed over.\nWith a turn of his hand, he struck with a backhand slash without warning!\n\"CHI!\"\nThe powerful saber blade hacked into the servant girl’s body savagely and her entire body was flung into the air, blood splattering all over the floor.\n\"EVERYONE GET FAR AWAY FROM HERE! DON’T COME NEAR!\" Lu Sheng’s voice boomed.\nAnd yet, it was too late. Once again, a few other guards had dashed over, sabers in hand.\nThe white shadow flew out in a flash, yet again entering into another body.\n\"AH!!!\" Lu Sheng bellowed in rage, pushing the Black Tiger Saber Technique’s momentum to its maximum under the thrust of Black Fury Skill.\nThe incensed roar of a mighty tiger once again sounded out around him.\nHis long saber slashed out at full strength like a giant boulder smashing into the ground, carrying with it the intense howling of the wind.\nThe guard who had been possessed instantly turned in the direction beyond the side door, as if thinking of escaping.\n\"RUMBLE!\"\nLu Sheng actually destroyed the walls of the yard near the side door in one ferocious stroke.\nBlade in hand, he charged through the broken wall and, in one vicious stroke, struck the skull of the possessed guard who had been caught off guard.\n\"AH, AH, AHHH!!!\"\nA woman’s shrill, tragic cries rang out.\nThe guard’s skull had been butchered into two, with bits of red and white splattered all over. Yet, he was still able to extend his hand and land a forceful blow with his palm onto Lu Sheng’s lower abdomen.\n\"BANG!\"\nLu Sheng fell back two steps, breathing heavily like an ox. A dense demonic aura permeated his whole body as an eerie blush flashed across his face.\nA bit of blood could be seen oozing from the corners of his mouth.\nLu Sheng once again raised his saber, but heard a clanging sound as the saber blade broke apart and fell to the ground.\nHe decided that he might as well throw the saber away, instead lunging forth to deliver two consecutive palm strikes.\nThis time round, the middle of his palms actually turned into a faint black under the activation of Black Fury Skill as he used Heart-Shattering Palm to strike.\n\"BAM, BAM!\"\nTwo thuds sounded out before the white shadow once again floated out from the guard’s body.\nShe still wanted to run.\nHowever, Lu Sheng moved his Black Fury Skill-infused palm to grab onto her clothes. Immediately, he felt as if he had grasped onto a block of ice.\nHowever, Qi, blood, and the Black Fury Qi that were coursing wildly through his entire body made him unafraid of this icy coldness in the least.\nThe second level of the Black Fury Qi within him rushed madly towards the white shadow’s clothes in his hands.\n\"DIEEE!!!\"\nLu Sheng exploded with all his power and hit out with abandon in that palm strike.\nAll the Black Fury Qi in his body seemed desperate to be released in this palm strike.\n\"BAM!!!\"\n\"AH!!!\"\nEventually, the white shadow let out a high-pitched scream as it was hit on the chest, causing her whole shape to instantly distort. With a ‘chi’ sound like that of shredding a piece of cloth into countless pieces, it exploded in an instant and vanished.\nLu Sheng’s eyes bore great killing intent. With a plop, he fell into a half-kneeling position on the ground.\nHe promptly spat out a mouthful of black blood.\nHands still shaking, he grabbed onto the broken saber on the floor and stabbed it into the ground unsteadily to support himself.\nJade Crane Skill and Black Fury Skill were spinning madly within him in an attempt to heal the injuries his body had suffered.\nBecause he had taken a blow earlier and over-exerted his strength, his meridians were unable to bear the pressure and became covered with a number of small cracks.\nWith both these serious injuries stacked on top of the other, Lu Sheng was unable to support himself any longer now that he relaxed his Qi and blood.\nAfter a long time had passed, the guards and housemen who had scurried far into the distance finally dared to come near. By then, Lu Quanan and the rest of the people had also rushed to the scene.\nEveryone was in a spate of shock when they saw the utter chaos at the scene.\nThen, they saw that Lu Sheng was half-kneeling on the ground, some blood on the corners with his mouth and another patch on the floor; clearly, he had just spat it out.\nLu Quanan ran over hastily.\n\"Little Sheng! Are you alright? Call the physician, quick!!!\" Anxiety could be seen on his face. He held onto Lu Sheng as he turned around and bellowed, \"What are you standing there for! COME HELP!!\"\nThe others seemed to finally awaken from their stupor and hurried forward to help lift Lu Sheng.\nEldest Uncle looked over the broken saber on the ground, the corpses, as well as the wall that had been broken through.\nThen, he turned to look at Lu Sheng, who was still billowing with killing intent as he panted badly. A slight shudder shook in his heart.\nHow could his nephew of just ten over years old have caused this scene? In fact, it was comparable to the work of the ferocious beasts from the mountain forests!\nHe had once chanced upon a black bear roaming the mountains and personally witnessed its might when it barged into a house. It had then caused a scene of devastation that was not unlike the one before his eyes.\n\"About what happened tonight, no one is to spread it beyond these walls! Otherwise…\" Eldest Uncle Lu Anping glared coldly at the group of people around.\n\"Come, clean up the mess. Do your best not to leave behind any traces.\"\nThe guards and housemen felt a chill down their spine as he glared at them.

In the pugilistic world, it can be considered a third-class martial art. But don’t underestimate it because of that. It’s got its strengths. Third-class secret manuals are good enough to make it into restricted libraries of great sects.\nTake it back and read it seriously, including the detailed posture diagrams. Follow them and practice by yourself for now. If you’re sure that you want to learn this technique after browsing through it, come to me afterwards. But regardless of whether you decide to learn it or not, you must remember to return this booklet to me.\"\nZhao Dahu carefully handed the booklet over to Lu Sheng.\n\"Alright!\" Lu Sheng understood that this likely was Zhao Dahu’s crown jewel.\nWhile he handed it over to him so easily, it by no means implied that Lu Sheng could learn the saber technique simply with the booklet alone.\nTraining in martial arts was highly demanding; it required many corrections of the details. It was not something one could learn easily by following some instructions on a booklet.\n\"Many thanks, Uncle Zhao!\" Lu Sheng received the booklet with great care.\nCarrying the Black Tiger Saber Technique booklet, he went straight back to his bedroom and closed the door. Alone, he lit the candles, flipped open the booklet and started reading its contents.\nBlack Tiger Saber Technique – though it was termed a \"saber technique\", it actually contained only a total of three moves.\nAll three were offensive moves.\nNo defensive moves, no evasion techniques... only offensive moves.\nThe first move – Tiger Kill.\nThe second move – Tiger Might.\nThe third move – Tiger Roar.\nThe moves were simple: they were basically three different saber strokes, each having different strengths and effects.\nLu Sheng looked at it briefly and roughly understood it. Simple as those strokes were, their might depended on one’s familiarity with them as well as one’s strength and speed.\nStrength and speed, in turn, relied on one’s body coordination when employing force.\nHence a mantra came along with those three saber strokes as part of the package.\nThe so-called mantra was essentially a guide to thought and mental activity, applied to daily life, which maximized the power of the saber technique. It was basically what people termed as adjusting the mental world.\nStroke techniques for adjusting The External, mantra for adjusting The Internal: the two combined to achieve the ultimate integration of one’s mind, body and soul.\nThe Black Tiger Mantra was divided into three levels. There were no special names for the levels; they were simply called Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.\nOnly when one mastered the mantra and became familiar with the external stroke techniques as described in the booklet could one be considered as having achieved full mastery of the saber technique.\nLu Sheng closed the booklet lightly and sat by the table in silence for a long while, unceasingly memorizing all the challenging parts of the Black Tiger Saber Technique and revising them over and over again.\nThen, he called out in his mind. \"Deep Blue.\"\nImmediately, the Deep Blue Skills Modifier screen appeared before his eyes.\nEnclosed within the blue-bordered frame were rows after rows of small boxes. The box in the first row of the first column, at this moment, displayed his present status.\nLu Sheng --\nMartial Arts:\nBlack Tiger Saber Technique: Uninitiated.\"\nThe display was very simple and contained only the Black Tiger Saber Technique that he had just browsed through once.\n‘It really… it really wasn’t a hallucination!’ Lu Sheng’s body stiffened immediately.\nNot out of fear, but... out of excitement!\nThis world was way too dangerous.\nHe was originally content to be a parasite, living without care or worry for the rest of his life. But now it felt like he had just fallen into a snake’s den and became surrounded by many poisonous snakes. If he were to accidentally fall prey to one of them, he would instantly become a minor character in some horror myth – dead beyond death. [1]\n‘But now, there’s finally a glimmer of hope… if this modifier really works…’ Lu Sheng suppressed the excitement within his heart and began recalling the cheating device’s functions which he had written into its code.\nThe Deep Blue Skills Modifier had only one function, and that was to modify the martial arts skillset of the main character in the game.\nIt could modify the level of one’s martial arts directly into the pinnacle level of complete mastery. But what it could not do was modify one’s level of familiarity with the martial arts, blood volume, strength, speed, inner force… etc.\nThe only thing it could modify was the level of the martial arts that one was already initiated in.\n‘The only thing I can modify in this box is this Black Tiger Saber Technique. How do I begin the modification?’ Lu Sheng began fiddling around.\nAlone in his bedroom, his hands were subconsciously flipping through the booklet, but his attention was actually focused on the Deep Blue Skills Modifier in his mind.\nHe scrutinized the modifier, over and over again. Quickly, he discovered a tiny button right at the bottom of the modifier.\nOn it was written: Begin Modification.\n‘This is it.’\nWith a thought, he pressed deeply onto the button, as if with a finger.\nImmediately, the entire screen flashed, and he suddenly felt that he could control everything in the Modifier at will.\nIt was a miraculous feeling. But rather than dwelling on it, Lu Sheng’s attention quickly focused entirely on the Black Tiger Saber Technique.\nThe status display after the Black Tiger Saber Technique read \"Uninitiated\". But in that very moment, when he focused his attention on it, its status jumped in a flash. It turned into \"Initiated\".\nDelighted, Lu Sheng eagerly focused his attention on Black Tiger Saber Technique.\nVery swiftly, the Black Tiger Saber Technique jumped again and turned into Level 1.\nAfter that was Level 2, Level 3…\n\"It’s done!\" Lu Sheng was filled with delight. Looks like the modifier worked indeed.\nBut, just as he was ready to kick back and relax, the Black Tiger Saber Technique jumped again!\n\"Level 4!!\"\nThe Black Tiger Saber Technique jumped to Level 4 in one sitting!\n\"Boom!\"\nJust as the Black Tiger Saber Technique advanced to Level 4, Lu Sheng felt a loud boom go off in his mind.\nA splitting headache came upon him and his body began trembling violently as if he was struck by lightning.\nHe collapsed onto the table. After a long period of recovery, he finally lifted his head with difficulty.\nIt felt wet beneath his nose, and he sniffed out a hint of blood’s smell.\nLu Sheng lifted his hand and gently rubbed on it. It was dark-red blood.\nHis eyes were unfocused and every single spot all over his body was sore. His body felt devoid of any strength; even standing up took a great deal of effort from him.\nLifting his arms, he saw a terrible-looking patch of white on the skin at the back of his palms. He couldn’t keep his eyes open and felt extremely sleepy.\n‘These are symptoms of a serious blood loss!’ Though Lu Sheng did not have medical training, he at least possessed some basic common knowledge... enough to know that he might be suffering from a serious blood loss.\nSitting by the table, he just barely propped himself up and kept the booklet. Then he collapsed onto the bed to rest.\n\"Little Qiao!\"\n\"Yes, Young Master? What are your instructions?\" Little Qiao asked softly outside the door.\n\"Go… cook me some red dates porridge and add some ginseng into it. Use an aged one,\" Lu Sheng said with great difficulty.\nThat was the good thing about being a rich man’s kid. Average families treated normal ginseng as a life-saver, not to mention aged ginseng. Which family could eat it as a tonic like Lu Sheng was about to do?\nLittle Qiao acknowledged and quickly ran to the kitchen to relay his instructions to the cooks.\nLying alone on the bed, Lu Sheng rested for a long while, but his vision remained somewhat dark and he felt devoid of strength in his limbs.\nYet, ignoring these sensations, he stretched out his arm and, to his surprise, a practiced muscle memory and intuition that was the result of years of familiarity and practice with saber flooded from his palms into his mind.\nThe three moves of the Black Tiger Saber Technique and the three levels of its mantra had unknowingly become etched indelibly onto his mind.\nHe now thoroughly comprehended the three stroke moves, even the hidden subtleties behind them. Not only that, he also understood inside out how the mantra complemented the different strokes.\n\"It really worked!?\" Lu Sheng closed his eyes, his heart in ecstasy.\nThe experiment had succeeded.\nAlthough it had consumed his blood and mental energy, it was worth it in exchange for the full mastery of the Black Tiger Saber Technique.\n‘But, the Black Tiger Saber Technique clearly has only three levels. So where did this fourth level come from?’ That was what baffled Lu Sheng.\nMoreover, the fourth level of the Black Tiger Saber Technique now felt extremely familiar to him in his mind.\nIt was as if… as if he created it personally in the first place!\nThe subtle philosophy and ideological underpinnings hidden within it were not something that a person of this world could conjure up, rather, it seemed to be the product of modern scientific theories of force.\nAlthough he was just a civil servant, he had at least taken classes on engineering, sports, science and the likes.\nBefore he could continue that line of thought, Little Qiao brought the porridge over.\n\"Coincidentally, some blood-restoring porridge was cooked for Third Young Miss, also with red dates as its main ingredient. But Third Young Miss doesn’t want it, so I brought it over for Young Master. This is Lily Red Dates Broth, good for calming the mind and restoring blood. I’ve also added ginseng into it. Do you want it, Young Master?\" Little Qiao asked softly outside the door.\n\"Bring it in,\" Lu Sheng replied softly.\nLittle Qiao gently pushed open the doors and walked in. But immediately upon entering, she saw the trace of blood on Lu Sheng’s collar.\n\"Mas…Mas…Mas… Young Master, what happened to you!!?\" Little Qiao was so shocked she almost spilled the porridge on the floor.\nLu Sheng grimaced.\n\"I’m fine.\"\n\"You still say you’re fine! You’ve even vomited blood!\" Xiao Qiao’s face had turned pale with fright.\n\"I really am fine…\" Lu Sheng replied helplessly.\nLittle Qiao hurried to serve Lu Sheng the bowl of porridge in her hands. \"Come Young Master, drink some hot porridge first.\"\nWith her assistance, Lu Sheng finished the entire bowl of porridge, one mouthful at a time.\nHaving finished eating, he felt more at ease.\nHe began to recall in detail all of the assorted pieces of information and experience pertaining to the Black Tiger Saber Technique that had suddenly popped up in his mind.\nStrangely, these were stored in his mind as if they were there right from the beginning. There was no difficulty involved in comprehending them and he felt as if it would be a piece of cake for him to execute them in practice.\nIf not for the current state of his body, he would have searched for a saber in the arena and begun practising.\nAfter he had finished the porridge, Little Qiao quickly left for the pharmacy to look for the Lu Manor’s doctor-in-residence. She was still worrying about Lu Sheng’s health.\nLu Manor possessed its own exclusive doctor – a thin elderly man sporting a goatee.\nCarrying a giant medicinal chest on his back, he hurried over.\nHe sat down beside Lu Sheng’s bed and touched his pulse. After that, his brows unknotted themselves.\n\"It’s nothing much, just a loss of blood. Also, too much mental energy had been expended. He just needs to rest for a few days,\" he pulled out a slip of paper and began scribbling a tonic prescription on it.\n\"Take this to the pharmacy, and feed the Young Master with it twice a day for ten days and he’ll fully recover.\"\n\"Thank you, doctor.\"\nLu Sheng heaved a sigh of relief. It was exactly the same as his own diagnosis.\nNot long later, Lu Fang aka Lu Quanan also arrived.\n\"What happened?\" He had come with his second and third mother. [2]\nLu Sheng’s own mother had died of sickness a long time ago. It was his second mother who raised him.\nHis second mother Liu Cuiyu was mild-mannered and treated others with great generosity. She raised him like her own child, without any differential treatment between him and her own children.\n\"It’s just some blood loss from practicing martial arts. It’s nothing,\" one by one, Lu Sheng explained to his family members.\nAs the eldest son of the family, he was to inherit the family’s enterprise in the future and become its central pillar. Anything that happened to him would naturally immediately draw other’s concern.\n[1] ED/N: Literally rice weevil, figuratively sponger, parasite.\n[2] ED/N: The author literally seems to be saying second and third mothers… I’d rather use \"wives\" but it’d sound even more awkward later, so... Well, taking into account that it’s a different world, I guess it’s okay to allow the author some leeway for differences in common sense there (if it’s intentional, that is…)."}]}

Moreover, his meals all consisted of lavish portions of fish and meat as well as expensive medicinal tea each day.\nJust the expenditure on his meals alone would be enough to bankrupt an average family.\nLu Sheng did not dilly-dally along the way. Once he entered the city, he traced back the familiar road to the Lu Manor entrance.\nSeeing him approach, the doorman standing guard at the entrance immediately greeted him in welcome.\n\"Young Master is back!\"\n\"Mm,\" Lu Sheng gave a cursory reply before striding into the Manor.\nThere was a rather strange atmosphere within the Manor, but when the servants and helpers saw that he had returned, they all scurried around to greet him.\n\"Young Master is back!\" Someone shouted.\n\"Young Master! Young Master is back!\"\n\"Oh, it’s Young Master!\"\nOne of the servant-maids ran over in a hurry. A faint look of surprise mixed with joy could be seen on her face, akin to someone out of her wits who suddenly chanced upon a life-saving antidote.\n\"Where's Dad?\"\n\"The Family Head asks you to come over now,\" another servant-maid ran over and hastily replied.\n\"Mm.\"\nLu Sheng lowered his saber and placed it behind his back.\nHe rushed straight towards the inner yard.\nThe inner yard was a picture of quiet, to the extent that the silence was somewhat eerie, even cold.\nHe saw there several servant girls, each one more gloomy than the other. Those near him spoke out in greeting, but those further away didn't notice him and remained engrossed in their chitchat. Sounds of their conversation drifted from afar along with the wind.\n\"Yesterday night, there was the sound of a woman crying in Sister Yu’s room again.\"\n\"I heard about that too, it seemed to come from somewhere far away. Some of the guards walked past, but saw no one inside the room, not even a shadow.\"\n\"Oh please, let’s not talk about it anymore, it's so scary.\"\n\"Could it be a female ghost?\"\n\"Don’t spout nonsense! Be careful or you’ll get a beating.\"\nWith his saber behind him, Lu Sheng crossed the stone bridge and caught wind of the casual talk between the servant girls.\nFrom what these people were saying, Sister Yu’s Lily Flower Room at the back yard had since become the biggest restricted zone within Lu Manor.\nNo one needed any reminders to stay away; none of them dared to go near.\nHis mood fell. Putting the conversations together with the contents of the letter, his mood instantly turned dour.\nFinally, what he had feared this whole time had happened!\nThis world was already plagued with danger and malice all over. For an ordinary man, there was zero chance of resistance against any such strange occurrences.\nWhat he was worried about was that all that befell the Xu Family would one day suddenly strike the Lu Manor as well.\nWhen that happened, what could he use to resist it…? What could he use to save himself?\nWhat could he use to save his family in this life?\n‘Female ghost? Well, I want to see which female ghost can defend against MY saber!’ A fierce glint shone deep in his eyes, viciousness rising in his heart as he strode towards the Main Hall in the inner yard.\nWasn't all he had accumulated thus far for the sole purpose of countering that which was happening before his eyes?\nEntering the Main Hall within the inner yard, Lu Sheng’s gaze immediately fell upon the haggard Lu Quanan, who was sitting at the host’s seat. Next to him, Second Mother, Third Mother and the rest hurried over.\nAll his siblings and cousins from both maternal and paternal side were present.\nOther than during festivals or special occasions, this was the first time all family members had gathered together.\nAll of them turned to see Lu Sheng, burly and strapping as he strode in with saber on his back.\nA hint of joy appeared on Lu Quanan’s face, but turned into worry in an instant.\n\"Little Sheng, you… ai. You shouldn't have come back.\"\n\"Dad, just say it. What happened? Sister Yu died?\" Lu Sheng wasted no time as he asked straightforwardly.\nRecently, he had been practicing saber strokes everyday. On top of that, Black Fury Qi constantly flowed through him. All this lent a sliver of fierce, murderous air to him.\nSeeing this, those present then remembered that Brother Sheng had actually killed two thoroughly fiendish and cruel fugitives. He was a ferocious character who could kill even murderers.\nAt that thought, their originally frightened and anxious hearts were somewhat soothed for the moment.\n\"Let me tell you what happened instead,\" Second Mother Liu Cuiyu sighed and said.\nLu Sheng found a seat to the right. \"Please go ahead, Second Mother.\"\nLiu Cuiyu pondered for a moment as she organized her thoughts.\n\"This matter begins with Sister Yu’s sudden death a while back.\"\nShe sighed again.\n\"That day, someone from Sister Yu’s family came over to ask me if Sister Yu had gone back, to which I replied that she had already left way before he came to inquire.\nThat man then said that her family had waited for a long time to no avail, and thus he came to the Manor to look for her.\nI also had my suspicions, and was just about to send someone out in search when we received news from the yamen that Sister Yu had died in an alley. It had been a few days, and her corpse was already frigid.\nAfterwards, I forked out some silver to count towards Sister Yu’s funeral expenses. But only two days after that incident, another person from the Manor went missing as well. I sent some people out to search, they found the corpse in a river beyond the city.\"\nLiu Cuiyu’s face was awash with sorrow as she recounted till here.\n\"From that day onwards, one person from the Manor would go missing everyday. We haven’t been able to find out anything! It’s already the fifth day today.\nAnd every night, faintly discernible sounds of a woman’s wails would drift out from the Lily Flower Room where Sister Yu used to stay. We went in to investigate, but there was no one inside.\nThere used to be five people who stayed in that room. Now, of the five, three have already gone missing…\"\nHearing that, Lu Sheng’s face was already the picture of gloom.\n\"What did the people at the yamen say?\"\n\"What can they say? They know absolutely zilch! They gave some random excuse to shirk their responsibility and left,\" Lu Chenxin couldn't help but interrupt, his voice laced with fury.\n\"I got your Eldest Uncle to send some men to keep watch during the night, but that wasn't too helpful either. When there are many people around, that sound doesn’t appear; we can only hear it when there are few people around,\" Lu Quanan shook his head and said.\n\"Where’s Qingqing?\" Lu Sheng suddenly realized that Lu Qingqing was actually missing from the crowd.\n\"She ran off on her own to the Zheng Family. Something has also cropped up there,\" Lu Quanan said helplessly.\n\"Something has also cropped up at the Zheng Family?\" Lu Sheng’s heart constricted.\n\"But it’s not like our problem, rather, they met with some bandits who attacked their merchant groups on the road. I don’t know where that lass Qingqing managed to find a lead, but she now suspects that the bandits are related to the Xu Family incident. She went out yesterday to investigate and has not been back since,\" Second Mother Liu Cuiyu remarked.\nLu Sheng gave a cold snort. \"This lass is getting more and more out of hand. On the other hand, for the matter within the Manor, even if it’s not a female ghost, a highly skilled expert in qinggong will also be able to do such a thing! What about Uncle Zhao? What does he think?\" [1]\n\"Your Uncle Zhao and a few of the other uncles have all been conscripted to the yamen to support the forces somewhere outside the city. Come to think of it, they still have not returned yet,\" Lu Quanan replied.\n\"Which is to say, that person took advantage of their absence and that’s why he dares to come to the Manor to pretend to be a ghost?\"\nLu Sheng’s first words deemed this matter to be the work of man rather than the work of demons, devils, ghosts or monsters.\nRegardless of whether this was the work of the supernatural or not, it could only be declared the work of man on the surface!\nOtherwise, the mighty and illustrious Lu Family might just fall apart.\nLu Quanan also immediately understood this principle and nodded in reply.\n\"Now that you say it, it really does seem like the work of man…\"\n\"There’s someone crying in Sister Yu’s Lily Flower Room at night, right? I’ll go stay there tonight. Let’s see if anyone else goes missing,\" Lu Sheng decided.\n\"But, Little Sheng…\" Lu Quanan wanted to add something else, but Lu Sheng raised his hand to stop him.\n\"Don't worry Dad, I know what I’m doing,\" Lu Sheng said calmly.\nNo matter whether the other party was a man or a ghost, since it was afraid of crowds, then there would definitely be a viable solution to this.\nIf this small obstacle before them proved insurmountable, then if they met with a vicious character like the one that suddenly wiped out the whole Xu Family, wouldn't they be relegated to being helpless lambs facing a butcher?\n\"Little Sheng… you must be careful…\"\nLiu Cuiyu was worried.\nThe rest of the people, on the other hand, looked as if a huge burden had been lifted off their shoulders.\nSince Brother Sheng, who had even killed fugitives before, said that it was the work of man, then it very likely could be true.\nWith Brother Sheng around, surely that thug would very soon be captured.\nOnce the meeting ended, Lu Chenxin, Lu Tianxiang, Lu Yingying and the rest went out to spread this piece of news at the first possible moment.\nSoon, near evening time, each and every person within the Lu Manor knew that Young Master Lu Sheng had returned, and even assessed that this spate of events was the work of man!\nMoreover, he had decided to keep watch during the night in Lily Flower Room!\nWhen this news spread, the entire Manor from the top to the bottom immediately heaved a great sigh of relief.\nThese few days, the Lu Manor’s denizens’ tension had pent up to an extremely high level. Just like a string instrument—if its strings were to be wound too tightly, they would break. Their nerves were not far from reaching that point.\nMomentarily, everyone felt a lot more at ease.\nAlthough the threat had not been averted, the atmosphere of fear and panic from before had relaxed quite a bit.\nYoung Master was personally staying in the Lily Flower Room and could deal with the wailing, come what may. Even if something cropped up, Young Master would definitely be there to be the first one to deal with it.\nAfter enquiring into the entire incident from A to Z, Lu Sheng immediately sent someone to tidy up the Lily Flower Room and prepare some mattress and the like. He would stay there by himself tonight.\nOthers tried to persuade him otherwise, but seeing that he had a steely resolve, they could only give up.\nLu Sheng got Little Qiao to return to his original sleeping quarters. A saber in one hand and a pitcher of medicinal tea in another, he walked into the Lily Flower Room by himself.\nLily Flower Room, Lily Leaf Room and Lotus Room were the three areas in the Manor designated as the servant girls’ quarters. They were all packed closely together.\nOf them, Lily Flower Room was situated in the middle.\nLu Sheng came before the Lily Flower Room with his saber in hand. Not a soul could be seen in the neighboring two yards; clearly, they were all frightened away by the wails during the night.\nHe pushed open the door to find the place tidied up spotless and a bed arranged there nicely. A meal box was placed on the stone table in the little yard.\nOther than that, the whole place was deserted.\nAtop the greyish white stone table were still some traces of pink, which appeared to be the remnants spilt from the cosmetic powders women used.\nLu Sheng eyed the sleeping quarters.\nThe sleeping quarters and the little yard combined seemed to form a square box. The sleeping quarters were split into five individual units which were lined up together, the doorway acting as the corridor. He followed down the corridor and exited into the little yard, where he saw a well and a set of stone table and stools next to it.\nLu Sheng sat next to the well like a big shot, all-imposing. He opened the dark-red meal box, taking out plates upon plates of side dishes and placing them all onto the stone table.\nThere were three side dishes and one soup, coupled with steaming hot white rice.\nPicking up his chopsticks, Lu Sheng began to eat with relish.\nHe took almost an hour to finish this one meal, cleaning up every last bit of that extravagant spread. Only then did he burp and come to a stop. [2]\nThe sky gradually dimmed into the night. Lu Sheng lit some candles and lanterns by himself, casting the little yard and Sister Yu’s sleeping quarters into bright light.\nThe five sleeping quarters were arranged in a line, with Sister Yu’s the furthest one in. The light that traveled within was limited, and sounds from outside that trailed in would also be reduced to a mere whisper.\nLu Sheng finished his meal, walked down the corridor with a saber in hand, and entered the room.\nInside the room there were a black wooden bed, a square table and three chairs. Besides those, there was a cupboard and a dressing table.\nBehind the dressing table was a window.

In comparison, this child Lu Sheng’s actions indeed showed much more ambition than the others’ actions. As the chiding words appeared at the tip of his tongue, they turned into a sigh instead.\n\"If you want to practice martial arts, then you’d better find your Uncle Zhao and learn from him rather than practice blindly by yourself; it can easily lead to mishaps,\" he shook his head and turned to walk out of the door. Halfway there, he paused and added,\n\"If you need any medicine from the pharmacy, just go ahead. I’ll give you two thousand talents each month for your monthly allowance…\" He left in big strides after he had finished speaking.\nSecond mother Liu Cuiyu reached out and lightly wiped Lu Sheng’s perspiration off with a towel.\n\"Your father’s quite soft-hearted,\" she gave a long sigh.\n\"The Xu family’s Old Master and he were sworn brothers… Now that this has happened, he’s feeling very miserable. It’s good for you to practice martial arts. It’s just that, most who do so begin from a young age to establish a solid foundation. At this age now, it is rather late…\"\nShe prattled on and on about other things, but Lu Sheng was entirely unable to hear what she said.\nHis attention was wholly focused on the Black Tiger Saber Technique that he had newly acquired.\n‘It’s really incredible…’\nLu Sheng narrowed his eyes a little. On the surface, it seemed like he was listening to his second mother, but in reality he was assessing the state of his body.\nHe flexed his biceps.\n‘The muscles on my arms are the same as they were. Yet, there’s this feeling of familiarity, a strong sense of muscle memory as if I’ve undergone many years’ practice. It’s simply…’\nHe again tried to flex his muscles, this time on his legs.\nClearly, the muscles on his legs could exert strength much more easily than previously.\nHe could distinctly feel his strength from both his legs quickly coursing upwards, all the way to his waist and then to both his arms.\nThis fluidity in the flow of strength was described in great detail in the Black Tiger saber Technique.\nThis was called Strength Proficiency.\n‘If it is as the saber Technique says, most people who practice martial arts would have a method to circulate a huge amount of the body’s strength. One is already considered an expert if he is able to mobilize 50% of his total physical strength. To be able to mobilize 80% of one’s strength means to enter the so-called Strength Proficiency realm.’\nLu Sheng considered those things in his mind while taking into account the memories originally present in his current body as well as what he had once heard from Uncle Zhao and in conversations with other martial experts regarding the matter.\nThe Strength Proficiency realm was reckoned to be more or less one of the very highest levels achieved by those within Nine Links City.\nEven for a normal person, to be able to consolidate their strength and focus it into one strike would result in a terrifying speed and strength far surpassing the limits of an ordinary person.\n‘Uncle Zhao is exactly in that Strength Proficiency realm…’ Lu Sheng sighed inwardly. The effects of the Modifier were not compromised in the slightest. This thoroughly removed the worry weighing down on his heart.\n\"It’s a pity that the Modifier seems to expend a combination of one’s mental energy, Qi and the sort. Just modifying an ordinary saber technique once has actually almost caused me to lose both qi and blood to the point of being bedridden… and it’s not even one of those legendary inner force or Qi skills.\"\nLu Sheng was gradually coming to understand the essential nature of the Modifier.\nIt was basically just like an adjustment device that was able to imprint one’s body with experience, memories, instincts and martial arts.\nHowever, this sort of adjustment required energy consumption, which apparently occurred at the expense of his mental energy and Qi.\nMoreover, there was no guarantee of instant success when adjusting one’s body and mind.\n‘The body is like a pile of materials. The Modifier seems to make use of these materials, and establishes a new foundation upon the original base. But it cannot just increase the muscle strength or bone strength from nothing.’ Lu Sheng obtained hypothesized.\nIn the following few days, the changes to his body also confirmed his hypothesis.\nIt began to slowly recover since Day One. At the same time, sturdy muscles gradually formed on his arms, legs, chest and back.\nMoreover, Lu Sheng felt an obvious change as the pain in his body turned to numbness. On his palms, a thick horny layer steadily appeared. [1]\nHis appetite also grew larger and larger.\nIn order to hide these sudden changes, he would sneak out by himself each day to have extra meals outside.\nFour meals within the house: three basic meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) plus a midnight snack.\nOutside, he would still eat the same portions as he did at home.\nThis carried on for seven days. After that, Lu Sheng’s whole body became slightly sturdier, and his stature was no longer as thin and weak as it used to be in the past.\nAs for the saber technique manual, he had long since returned it intact to Uncle Zhao.\nHaving heard how he was ill and bedridden, Uncle Zhao didn’t say anything much. When he received the manual, he merely shook his head and sighed without raising the matter of the saber practice.\nLu Sheng guessed that Uncle Zhao probably thought that he had recklessly tried to practice and hurt himself as a result.\nIndeed, Uncle Zhao’s thoughts were just like that.\nInitially, he had wanted to wait till Lu Sheng faced difficulties in saber practice before helping him clarify his doubts and clear up any confusion. Who knew that, in the blink of an eye, he would hear that Young Master Lu Sheng would be bedridden from injuries. And then, he had even come to return the secret manual, without mentioning the matter of the Black Tiger Saber Technique again.\nThus, he concluded that Lu Sheng was no longer interested and had given up.\nRegarding this, Uncle Zhao could only sigh and say nothing.\nEverything returned to as it had been in the past days.\nThe Xu family’s demise seemingly did not have a big influence on life in the Lu Manor.\nThe younger generation continued with their hikes, drank their flower wine, listened to tunes, went horse riding, attended poetry shows and flower exhibitions. Although Nine Links City was not huge, it was not small either; there were plenty of these entertainment establishments.\nAs for the older generation, they occasionally attended this and that gathering and went to the city to participate in yamen’s meetings.\nLu Quanan also buried his head in devoting all of his energy to business dealings.\nIt seemed that everyone had already forgotten about the Xu Family’s tragedy. They once again lived the same lives as before.\nThat is, with the exception of two people.\nOne of them was Lu Yiyi. Having lost her fiancé, her sweetheart, her face was continually bathed in tears. She looked more and more haggard.\nThe other was Lu Sheng. He now liked to venture out a lot more.\nHe didn't go to enjoy himself by listening to music and dancing, but rather went outside the city to find a clear patch in the small forest nearby.\nThere, he minded his own business and started to attempt practicing the Black Tiger Saber Technique.\n***\nBlack winds blew among the mountain ridges located along the southwest region of Nine Links City.\nThe sound of wind whistled in the dark night.\nLu Sheng was hurrying in their direction, carrying a long-hilted saber he had bought at a blacksmith’s shop.\nHe did not intend to reach Black Winds Ridge; he merely wanted to find an opportunity to test his saber skills.\nHe had obtained the Black Tiger Saber Technique through the Modifier, which he did not intend to divulge. This would be his ultimate trump card.\nTo outsiders, everyone believed him to be an ordinary young master of a wealthy family, too weak to even truss a chicken.\nUsing their prejudice, he could rely on this skill of his to turn the tables on his opponent should he find himself in a dangerous situation.\nOf course, all this was dependent on the actual usefulness of the Black Tiger Saber Technique in combat.\nLu Sheng wasn't sure where Black Winds Ridge exactly was, or how far it was from Nine Links City.\nThere was no night curfew in Nine Links City; its city gates were open even at night. He changed into a simple and plain clothing and then used ladies’ cosmetic powder to slightly alter his appearance. Alone, he dressed in thick clothes and lowered his head to cover his face.\nAnd so, he became just a random tourist whom nobody knew.\nBorrowing the dark of the night, Lu Sheng left the city, his eyes gazing into the distance.\nThe pitch-black wilderness of the mountains seemed like a huge, hibernating beast, concealed in the silence under the moon.\nHis heart was beating quickly.\nHowever, he had to hide himself if he wanted to test out the true power of the Black Tiger Saber Technique.\nStanding in front of the city gate, he plucked up his courage and walked in the direction of Black Winds Ridge.\n\"Ding, Ding, Ding…\"\nA caravan returning in the night was just entering the city from the main road.\nThe wind chimes that hung on the carriages rang out as they swung about in the wind, their sound carrying far into the distance of the night.\nLu Sheng exited the city from the side doors.\nThe city gates of Nine Links City were very strange. Not only were they kept open through the night, there was quite a number of them as well. The walls seemed tall and sturdy, but the truth was that there were many cracks in the walls, air seeping through them. It was hardly useful for defense at all.\n\"Returning late at night again today?\"\n\"Precisely… it’s pitch-dark at night, and the carriage wheels were twisted while rushing back. What bad luck!\"\nThe leader of the caravan and the city guards talked on the main road at the central city gates; the sound of their conversation floated over.\nLu Sheng stood on a small road facing southwest. In comparison to the main road, this one was a lot narrower.\nOnly two torches on the city walls lit the black side doors. Dim light emanated from them, lighting up a mere half a meter or so of the way ahead.\n\"This is indeed the ancient times…\" Lu Sheng heaved a sigh in his heart.\nLooking out, it was pitch-black in all of the three directions ahead. Only Nine Links City at the back offered some light.\n\"No flashlights or street lights. The wilderness of the ancient times is simply a paradise for the wild predators.\"\nHe hesitated for a slight moment, but experience from the Black Tiger Saber Technique that surged through his body caused his fear to diminish.\nThis was because the Black Tiger Saber Mantra provided a method to deal with such a pitch-black environment.\nOr rather, the Black Tiger itself was an excellent hunter that could see well in pitch-darkness. The Black Tiger Saber Technique demanded one to be sensitive to the sounds of the wind to determine one’s surroundings, and thus its users did not fear such an environment.\nTightening his belt, Lu Sheng grasped the long-hilted saber tightly, walking onto the narrow road towards Black Winds Ridges with haste.\nAbout a hundred meters along the narrow road, he withdrew two flints from his waist pouch, and lowered a small torch from his back that he had prepared earlier.\nWith a flint at the head of the torch, he exerted all his might to rub another against it.\n\"POP!\"\nSparks sputtered out from the head of the torch.\nThe red sparks appeared in a small number, but then spread to the whole head of the torch.\nThere was finally some light in the pitch-darkness.\nLu Sheng turned and gazed backwards. The lights from Nine Links City were already very faint.\nHe lifted the torch and proceeded forward slowly.\n‘According to what the hunter said, a wild wolf often roams this stretch of road at night. Well, we’ll see how good my luck is.’\nHe did not dare to really go to Black Winds Ridge. Having learnt that there was a high likelihood that things like ghosts and monsters existed in this world, he naturally did not dare to venture too far away from the city.\nIf it weren’t for the fact that he was still unable to test out the true ability of his skills even after devising various methods while inside the city, he would not have come out here alone to try his luck.\nAfter continuing onwards for another stretch of distance, he soon noticed tracks on the ground.\nJust as the old hunter had said, these were the tracks of a wild wolf.\nThere were also a few pieces of white, clayish egg-shaped feces.\nLu Sheng picked up a stone to poke the feces. It was already dried and hardened by the wind. As it broke apart from the poking, something like fingernail parts was revealed from the inside.\n‘It should be this place… This lump of feces should be from a few days ago. According to the words of the old hunter, he just saw that old wolf here yesterday. It should be somewhere around here.’\nLu Sheng held the torch in one hand, while the other unhurriedly drew the long-hilted saber from behind his waist.\nThe long-hilted saber was a type of a saber derived from a combination of a weapon and a farming tool. It had a very long hilt.\nThe hilt and the blade of Lu Sheng’s saber were roughly of the same length. When the blade was removed, it could be used as a pole for farming. It was somewhat similar to a small glaive.\nIt took him quite some strength to wield it with one hand. He might as well stick the torch into the crack of a stone that lay at the side.\nHe was surrounded by messy heaps of stones in weird shapes and sizes. There weren’t any trees around, and thus there was no fear of anything catching fire.\nLu Sheng stuck the torch in between the rocks and carefully retrieved a paper bag from his waist pouch. Inside it, there was a slab of fresh pork he had carved out earlier this afternoon.\nHe slowly unfolded the grease paper and lay it onto the ground.\nThere were still traces of blood on the surface of the meat slab. A raw smell of blood soon wafted in the wind, spreading around the area.\nLu Sheng lifted his saber and hid himself a short distance away, hunched behind a big rock, waiting.\nThe wind was rather cold.\nLu Sheng tilted his body, sticking to the white rock that was slightly taller than a person, and gazed in the direction of the meat slab.\nTime passed by slowly.\n\"Howl…\"\nSoon, the wind brought with it a faint sound, similar to the wind yet reminiscent of the whimpering of some animal.\n\"HOO!\"\nSuddenly, a black shadow flashed from the side. The light from the torch reflected in and revealed a pair of lush green eyes.\nThe black shadow moved with extreme speed. In a moment, it pounced on the meat slab, held the meat in its mouth, and sped away.\nLu Sheng rejoiced, and was about to move.\nSuddenly, his back tightened as a gust of cold wind blew against it.\nLu Sheng’s eyes went wide. Lifting the long-hilted saber, he turned around and swung it, delivering a horizontal slash.\n[1] ED/N: \"Horny\" as in hard and rough.

He had thoroughly committed the Heart-Shattering Palm to memory.\nThen, he went to find the other elder.\nThe second teacher recommended by Uncle Zhao was surnamed Du, first name Zhen. He was a top expert in the former Prefect’s yamen, and belonged to the same generation as Chief Constable Zhang Xun.\nHis ninety-nine strokes of the Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade were as fast as lightning. A pity that, without rhyme or reason, someone had injured his hand tendons, incapacitating him. Because he never married, he was similarly without children. As a taciturn introvert, he also had no other heirs.\nLu Sheng stayed there to learn for a total of four days.\nActually, in his eyes, the ninety-nine strokes of the Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade paled slightly in comparison to the Black Tiger Saber Technique. However, it was always a good thing to acquire more martial arts skills.\nThen, he again implored Uncle Zhao to bring him one-by-one to other famous experts within Nine Links City, especially those of the older generation.\nAfter receiving his father Lu Quanan’s nod of approval, he was able to use money to pave his way. He was again able to learn from two others: he learnt the Precious Eight Steps and the Double-Horned Blade.\nBoth martial arts were relatively weaker than the Black Tiger Saber Technique. After all, he understood that Black Tiger Saber’s Uncle Zhao was one of the finest experts within Nine Links City. It wasn't an easy feat for others to reach the same level.\nFor two consecutive months, Lu Sheng persevered and assiduously trained in all sorts of different martial arts. At the same time, he continued to stuff his body with copious amounts of Yin-nourishing and blood-nourishing prescriptions.\nEver since he started to practice martial arts, his family had been spending more than a thousand talents a month to sustain his expenditure on herbal tonics. This was an astronomical sum for an average family.\nIt was a good thing that he had his father Lu Quanan’s backing. Otherwise, even a rich young master could not be so unrestrained and audacious in spending money.\nIn the blink of an eye, the summer passed and, with the coming of September, autumn arrived.\nIt had already been three months since Lu Sheng arrived in this world.\n\"Brother Sheng’s been really hardworking these days...\"\nUncle Zhao stroked his moustache, his gaze resting upon Lu Sheng who was currently diligently practicing the Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade on the arena.\nLu Sheng did not use the Modifier to modify this blade technique. He had been refraining from using the Modifier during this period, relying solely on himself to comprehend it.\nAt the end of the day, the Modifier was an external help. He wanted to see how the martial arts trained by himself fared in comparison to those he attained through the Modifier.\nCoincidentally, the Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade technique was fundamentally not difficult with its simple moves, and thus very suitable for him to train in slowly.\n\"Swoosh! Swish swish swish!\"\nCrisp sounds rang out one by one. The stacks of straw surrounding Lu Sheng were instantly hacked by the blade.\nLu Sheng held a small glaive, longer than a meter, with one arm. Swiftly, he flipped the glaive and fastened it behind his back. ‘Time to call it a day.’\n\"I started training martial arts too late; if I don't put in some effort, how will I catch up to others?\" Lu Sheng replied smilingly after a moment. \"I must really thank you, Uncle Zhao, for your help this period.\"\nUncle Zhao waved his hand.\n\"Brother Sheng, I know that you intend to gather the martial arts secret manuals to strengthen the family, but those in Nine Links City who’re willing to impart their martial arts are just these few. It’s very unlikely for the rest to do so. What are your plans from now on?\"\nLu Sheng fell deep in thought momentarily, allowing Little Qiao to wipe off his perspiration as she saw fit with a wet towel.\n\"Since Nine Links City…\"\n\"Bad news! Bad news!!\" Suddenly, a house servant hollered as he hurried over in the direction of the arena, his face white as a sheet.\n\"What happened? You’re noisy!\"\nA guard within the manor went forward and chided him. He pulled the servant aside as he questioned him in detail.\nAfter he had heard the reply, the guard’s facial expressions also changed somewhat. He hastily ran over to both Lu Sheng and Uncle Zhao.\n\"Young Master, Second Miss got into a fight with someone, and is now nowhere to be found!\" The guard exclaimed very anxiously.\n\"WHAT?!\"\nLu Sheng stood there stupefied.\nHe knew that Lu Qingqing would get into trouble when she got back, but had no idea it would happen so soon. [1]\n\"Where is she? Whom did she fight with?\" Uncle Zhao was solemn as he asked promptly.\n\"On Flower Willow Street, with a few guards of a merchant who had just entered the city as they were passing by.\"\n\"Does Old Master know of this?\"\n\"I’m not sure, but that servant just now received the news just a moment ago. Second Miss’ personal servant girl ran over to relay the info. He then came over to Young Master’ side as fast as possible,\" the guard replied quickly.\nThese people were all orphans Lu Quanan bought and cared for from young, nurturing them into adulthood. They were all highly loyal to the Lu Manor.\n\"Nice work. There’s no hurry to let Father know about this. I’ll go and take a look first,\" Lu Sheng said in a grim voice.\n\"Second Miss was looking into the tragic case of the Xu Family. How did she end up fighting with a merchant’s guards?\" Uncle Zhao asked suspiciously.\n\"We’ll know after we go take a look,\" Lu Sheng’s face was calm.\nThey gathered the servants and guards within the manor, chose ten of them and headed straight for Flower Willow Street.\nFlower Willow Street was a famous red-light district in Nine Links City. Only heavens knew why Lu Qingqing ended up here during her investigation.\nThe horses ran at full pelt the entire way.\nBy the time Lu Sheng arrived, the entire street was in complete disarray. The owners of two stalls near the Lu Family were comforting the peddlers in the vicinity that had suffered collateral damage.\n\"Pay for the damages to whomever we should, and apologize to whomever we need to. Don't let others look down on our Lu Family,\" Lu Sheng instructed.\n\"Yes!\"\nTen people who came with him replied immediately and dispersed to clean up the mess.\nAs for Lu Sheng and Uncle Zhao, they went over to the sidewalk to search for traces of the fight.\n\"Qingqing hadn’t left for a very long time, her temper has always been explosive. To be provoked by gangsters in such a place as this, it’s not at all strange for her to retaliate,\" Lu Sheng carefully checked the traces of blood on the floor.\nThere was not much blood, and he wasn’t worried that it was Qingqing’s blood. Given her ability, it was not difficult for her to go up against two people on the level of someone merchants hired as guards.\nA blotch of dark-red blood stained the greyish-white stone tiles. Under the glare of the sun, it was extra eye-catching.\nLu Sheng stooped down, lightly dabbing his finger into the blood and taking a sniff. Instantly, his brows furrowed.\n\"What happened? What did you discover?\" Uncle Zhao walked over and, just like Lu Sheng, dabbed his fingers into the blood before taking a sniff. \"This is ordinary human blood, nothing strange about it.\"\n\"That’s not what I’m puzzled over…\" Lu Sheng shook his head. \"What I’m puzzled over is that there is quite a large amount of blood here. Although Qingqing has a bad temper, she is not someone who would seriously wound her opponents. To draw so much blood… it’s not like her to be so reckless.\"\nAt this time, the guards who were settling matters in the area had also returned.\n\"Young Master, there’s news. Someone saw Second Miss, armed with a sword, fight with two others and chase them all the way outside the city! Someone else also said that those two she was pursuing were murderers wanted by the authorities, not some merchant’s guards!\"\n\"I see,\" Lu Sheng nodded. \"Come, we’ll go to the city gates to take a look. The nearest gate around here is the West Gate, they should have exited from there.\"\nA crowd of people followed him and swiftly headed for the West Gate.\nOver ten minutes later, the group arrived at the West Gate. A city guard came to greet one of the house servants; clearly, they knew each other.\n\"Second Miss Lu has given chase in the direction of the Black Winds Ridge,\" the guard provided them with a vital information.\nLu Sheng gathered the men to search for her and stepped out of the city. However, he made no more than several steps before Lu Qingqing could be seen in the distance, rushing back in the direction of the city gates. She rode on a horse, lugging with her two men, tied together.\nAs soon as she saw Lu Sheng, Lu Qingqing appeared very pleased.\n\"What are you doing rushing over here, Big Bro? Aren’t they just two petty thieves? Don’t you have any faith in my abilities?\"\nShe had changed and dressed up like a heroine, a longword resting within a silver sheath in her hands and a belt with golden trimmings attached to her waist. Her hair was cinched high atop her head, giving her an especially valiant and formidable look.\nLu Sheng stood at the city gates and waited for Lu Qinqing to arrive in front of him on her horse. Only when she flipped over and alighted from the horse did he heave a sigh of relief.\n\"Don't be so reckless in the future.\"\nAlthough he wasn't the original Lu Sheng, he had experienced Second Mother’s sincere care for him in this period. He wasn't a cold-blooded person or someone unable to discern who was sincere and who was hypocritical.\nBecause of Second Mother, he also had a slight sense of obligation to care for Lu Qingqing.\n\"Don't worry. Yours truly couldn't care less about these petty thieves in Nine Links City!\" Lu Qingqing said absentmindedly.\nLu Sheng looked at the two convicted murderers on the floor, tied together with a rope. Both of their faces were ashen, as if resulting from a severe blood loss. Currently, they were still unconscious and it was difficult to tell if they were even alive.\nBut what was bewildering was that there was a slight hint of a curve at the corners of their mouths; it seemed as if they were… laughing?\nLu Sheng made a mental note regarding this matter.\nSeeing that Lu Qingqing was unscathed, he did not say anything else. Perhaps he had made a mountain out of a molehill.\nAfter giving Lu Qingqing a few more words of advice, he and Uncle Zhao led the rest back to the manor.\nThe life once again went back to its original rhythm.\nEach day, he woke up and trained saber moves for six hours in the morning. After lunch, he then began working on his footwork and the Heart-Shattering Palm. At night, he returned to his room to practice the Jade Crane Skill.\nAs for the Black Fury Skill, he had decided to stop training in it.\nSeeing how he repeated this cycle, Uncle Zhao advised him to focus his energy on just one particular skill. However, Lu Sheng had other plans.\nAfter he had successfully placed all of the martial arts skills onto the Modifier selection screen, he once again began to upgrade the Jade Crane Skill’s level.\nIn the dead of the night.\nLu Sheng lay on his bed, his eyes gradually beginning to open.\nHe sat up ramrod-straight and looked at the paper window. Faint moonlight was streaming through it, leaving a distinct, white patch on the floor of the sleeping quarters.\nOutside the window, faint snoring sounds of the guard on night duty could be heard.\nThe wind blew fiercely, causing the tall trees within the courtyard to sway with a cacophony of swishing sounds.\nLu Sheng slowly sat up cross-legged on his bed.\n‘It’s about time.’\nHe listened intently to the sounds around him, but did not find anything that could be a disturbance to him.\n‘After cultivating for so long, my body’s essence, Qi and spirit are at their pinnacle. Now, it’s about time to upgrade the Jade Crane Skill.’\nIn these few days, Lu Qingqing had been performing heroic feats all around. She caused quite a stir as she went about, nabbing convicted murderers and injuring thieves and robbers.\nSeeing this, however, Lu Sheng’s heart was always troubled by an inexplicable sense of urgency. Particularly, in the past days, he heard from Master Zhang Xun that, when he was still the Chief Constable, he had also faced a few strange cases. Although in the end these cases were left unresolved, they all left a deep impression on him.\nCollecting his thoughts, Lu Sheng called out in his mind. ‘Deep Blue.’\nImmediately, a light-blue screen appeared in front of him.\nWith great familiarity, he pressed onto the Modify button and then focused all his concentration onto the selection for Jade Crane Skill.\n‘Upgrade one level!’\nThe selection panel instantly jumped from the first level to the second, like a walk in the park.\nA feeling as if the insides of his body were about to be hollowed out violently surged through him. It was as if, in a short amount of time, he had excessively indulged in debauchery.\nHis head buzzed and his vision blurred as a dizzy spell hit him.

Yesterday, Old Master called all heads of the businesses here, both minor and major, for a meeting. As they were leaving, I heard them say that everyone will have to help find it together. I wonder what it is, to go so far as to call all those big shots to help,\" Little Eight smiled as he thought about the matter.\nLu Sheng said nothing in response. However, he put on a rather gloomy expression. He walked past the main door to enter inside. As he walked, he asked him another question. \"Has anything strange happened lately?\"\n\"Er… Young Master, although Little Eight is considered well-informed, how can strange things happen everyday?\" Little Eight shrugged his shoulders helplessly. [1]\n\"Although… I heard that there was a big fire that broke out last night at the Goldfish Restaurant that you frequent. Half the side street was burnt away! Even though we servants were a long way off, we could still see the flames very distinctly from far away.\"\n\"A big fire…\"\nLu Sheng’s heart sank. He had a faint guess.\n\"Are you talking about that street that often sells cosmetic powders during the day?\"\n\"Precisely, just that!\" Little Eight nodded vigorously, \"I hear that quite a number of people died. Some of them were entire families, including the young and the old. It’s really awful… I wonder which heartless creature set the fire!\"\n‘A big fire…’\nLu Sheng said nothing more. He suppressed the matter deep within his heart and stopped thinking about it.\nThe Black Meeting was arranged to be at night in three days’ time, in a cellar outside the city.\nIn these three days, Lu Sheng rested and ate each day as usual. He could clearly feel his body growing sturdier, as if the Black Tiger Saber altered by the Modifier had also improved his physical state itself.\nIn those three days, he paid the street near Goldfish Restaurant a visit yet again. Sure enough, it was all charred and burnt. Quite a few people could be even seen being busy at rebuilding new houses.\nLu Sheng walked back along the road that he had gone before. It was exactly the same as he had seen the other day.\nEven that dead end of a back alley was just as it had been.\nHe now had a few guesses in mind, but did not feel fearful or anxious.\nSince there were water ghosts in this world, then naturally, other things could also exist.\nHe had initially intended to get initiated in that Jade Force on the ripped manual which he had bought during these three days, and then to modify it. However, as he thought of the Black Meeting, he decided to hold back for now. If he injured himself badly and spat out blood after modification again, he would lose this opportunity.\nTime passed by quickly. In the blink of an eye, it was the day of the appointment.\nIt was around seven or eight at night.\nLu Sheng changed into a set of black robes and put on the mask of a tiger. It was a toy for children that he had casually bought off the streets, and was very crudely made.\nIn front of the Lu Manor entrance, the Zheng Family’s horse carriage was already waiting.\nHe hurriedly boarded the horse carriage. Zheng Xiangui was currently sitting inside, biting off big chunks of meat from the braised chicken thigh he held in both his hands.\nThis fatso also wore a set of black robes. However, it didn't really matter – anyone could tell from his exaggerated physique that this guy was the Young Master of the faction hosting the Black Meeting.\n\"Good, you’re here, we’re just waiting for you. Brother Sheng, hurry, get on the carriage.\"\nBoth men sat down and the horse carriage slowly began to move.\nZheng Xiangui advised Lu Sheng throughout the journey on the dos and don’ts after entry, a whole host of messy details to pay attention to. Still, Lu Sheng committed each of them to his memory.\nSoon, they left the city. They travelled along a main road, from which they took a twist into a side road, then meandered along for quite a distance before heading directly into the outskirts.\nAfter travelling along the outskirts for a while, the horse carriage approached a little village tucked away in an overgrown wilderness area. It stopped in front of a stone house in the middle of the village.\n\"This is it,\" Zheng Xiangui jumped off the carriage. A black-robed man standing guard at the door of the stone house came forward and greeted him.\n\"Everybody’s present?\"\n\"Everybody’s present. The first auction item is already being displayed.\"\nZheng Xiangui nodded, anxiously urging, \"Let’s hurry inside, it’s already started.\"\nHe pulled Lu Sheng into the stone house. He opened a wooden door on the floor in the middle of the stone house, revealing a flight of stairs that led underground.\nLu Sheng followed behind Zheng Xiangui and two other guards down the stairs. At the bottom was a karst cave with a rather large surface area.\nThe karst cave was even prepared rather decently.\nThere was a big hall in the middle. In the surrounding stone walls was a circle of side rooms, each of them looking like little packets hanging on the walls.\nA few people were seated sparsely in the big hall. No firelight came from the surrounding little packets; clearly, they were not in use.\n\"Wow, this place has a rather huge layout,\" Lu Sheng exclaimed.\n\"Hehe, we discovered this place accidentally,\" the fatso said laughingly. He brought Lu Sheng in from the back of the big hall, and headed for the seats in the front row.\nOnly a little more than ten people in total attended the Black Meeting this time. They all sat scattered around the first row.\nA tall, skinny man whose face was veiled was standing on the stage. Currently, he was introducing the details of the item being auctioned in a loud voice.\nNext to him stood two dwarves. Both of them wore bright garish floral garments and held a bronze plate in their hands between them. There was a dagger on the plate, brown and spotty from rust.\n\"An ancient dagger passed down from Ju Rong Nation, most likely forged by Duan Fengzi of the olden days! There are some words carved on it in the national language of Ju Rong Nation, even if… aye! Guest No. Four bids one thousand talents! Any higher bids? Any higher bids!?\" The man on the stage yelled loudly with an extremely animated expression.\nLu Sheng and Zheng Xiangui sat on the seats to the left.\nThe rows of seats here all seemed to be carved out of white stone. It was extremely cold to the touch, emitting completely no warmth.\nFatso sat right next to him. He cocked his head and whispered, \"What you want is the fifth item, the second to last one.\"\nLu Sheng nodded his head wordlessly.\nClearly, the dagger on the stage had just been dug up from the ground not too long ago. It was perhaps found by a grave robber.\nThere were still quite a few people competing for it below. In just a short while, the bid for the dagger had risen to one thousand eight hundred talents.\nLu Sheng’s heart beat quickly as he listened to the proceedings. This was already twice the equivalent of his monthly allowance!\nHe did not watch the bidding competition on stage any longer. Instead, he diverted his attention to focus on the guests who were near him.\nMost of the guests to the Black Meeting carried with them weapons, ranging from short to long in size. Moreover, most of them were dressed in black and disguised, though there were also exceptions.\nOf the more than ten guests who were present, there were three who did not conceal their identity.\nOne of them was a man with red hair who wore a fitting yellow leather armor and carried a broadsword on his back.\nAnother was a very short, skinny and seemingly weak youth who had a beak-like mouth and sunken cheeks. Tied to his waist were two bulging black leather pouches that carried god-knew-what.\nThe third one was the most eye-catching.\nOr rather, it was a pair. A man and a woman.\nThe man’s clothes and a sword he carried on his waist conveyed a sense of strength; he seemed to be a bodyguard. He held an indifferent look that only softened for a bit when he gazed upon the woman.\nThe woman wore a black dress that was not one of the typical long dresses that women in ancient times wore. It was a tight dress whose hem and its surroundings looked like a body-hugging miniskirt that one would see on Earth.\nFrom head to toe, there was only that one piece body-hugging dress which barely covered her rear. Just a slightly bigger movement of lifting her legs would clearly reveal the space between her two legs.\nThis woman dressed sexily. She had long legs and a slender waist; a pair of white weapons at her chest threatened to tear the dress apart, looking as if at any moment the dress would burst at the seams near the chest area.\nLu Sheng could not help but look at the woman’s face.\nShe had a very high nose bridge and a pair of charming and glittering eyes that seemed to always be smiling. Her long black hair fell on her shoulders, so smooth and shining that they seemed to reflect a bit of light.\n‘This is so much more effective than any so-called Photoshop makeup technique,’ Lu Sheng praised in his heart.\nOne could tell that this woman was someone influential with a mere glance. Only one who was absolutely confident in one’s strength would dare to show such a beautiful face so freely at the Black Meeting.\n\"That’s Duan Muwan,\" seeing Lu Sheng’s attention had been attracted by the woman, Fatso promptly leaned in to whisper the introduction. \"But I don't recommend you trying to pick her up. This woman is beyond fierce!\"\n\"Fierce? How so?\"\nLu Sheng was mildly curious, but he did not have any designs on her. It was just that the woman was simply too eye-catching, so he was sizing her up.\nFatty smiled a little and looked towards the stage, at the second auction item that had already appeared.\n\"Duan Muwan came to Nine Links City about two months ago. I heard that she came along with a merchant group. The two of them, master and servant, joined the group by themselves. To walk such a long distance in itself is already not easy.\"\n\"Indeed, it’s no easy feat,\" Lu Sheng nodded.\n\"Moreover, because of her natural beauty, this woman has been very promiscuous since coming to Nine Links City. Quite a number of handsome young masters have been seduced by her and then, guess what happened?\" Fatso shook his head and sighed.\n\"What?\" Lu Sheng asked, his curiosity now piqued.\n\"All the young masters were infatuated beyond reason, resulting in a massive melee, which resulted in quite a number of injured and even quite a few killed,\" fatso said as he clicked his tongue.\n\"Even so, those who were seriously injured and handicapped remain devoted to this woman. But she’s already forgotten them in the blink of an eye!\"\nLu Sheng narrowed his eyes, a shiver in his heart. He had heard of these incidents, but never imagined that this woman was the cause of them all. For them to pine for her even after they were handicapped… this was not something that could be explained by her beauty.\nIn that moment, he labeled Duan Muwan as extremely dangerous in his mind. For her to be able to twist so many people around her little finger, she either had extremely high EQ or employed some unusual methods. It was best to stay as far away as possible from such characters.\nHe refocused his attention on the auction on the stage.\nIt was already the fourth auction item’s turn now: a yellow-bronze half-body leather armor.\n\"This leather armor is the Ice Wolf Armor, made of the combined, tanned hide of nineteen white wolves of the Ice White Grasslands. Nineteen layers of wolf hide are now as thin as a copper coin after tanning. Its resistance against both blunt tools and swords far exceeds that of a normal leather armor. It’s almost the same as wearing another layer of chainmail armor!\" The black-robed man exclaimed loudly to introduce this piece of leather armor.\n\"Starting bid price is two hundred talents!\"\nSilence. No one moved.\nThe host didn't seem to mind it very much. He got one of the dwarves to hold the leather armor before personally taking out a dagger and violently piercing into its side.\n\"Thud!\"\nA muffled sound rang out as the dagger slid off. Surprisingly, only a small scratch remained on the leather armor.\n\"Three hundred talents!\" Seeing that, someone immediately placed a bid.\n\"Four hundred talents!\"\n\"Six hundred talents!\"\nThe bids continued to rise higher and higher. Lu Sheng himself was rather moved when he saw it. This sort of leather armor was both lightweight and nimble, and was more convenient and flexible than the metal armor as it did not affect one’s movements. If its defense was really as strong as stated, then it indeed was a valuable item.\nHe wanted to state a price, but seeing that the bids arrived at almost one thousand talents in the blink of an eye, he could only restrain himself and give it up. His true goal was still the next item: the manual.\nHe could not lose sight of the big picture for this small item.\nIn the end, the leather armor was bought by the red-haired man with the broadsword on his back.

However, the smile on his face was filled with savagery.\n\"Yet another who has come looking for…\"\n\"CHI!\"\nLight flashed as it was deflected off the saber. This time it was Number Three who was the target.\nLu Sheng’s figure flashed in front of Number Three. Fresh blood splurted out again.\nNumber Three’s head was now gone as well. It rolled across the ground before coming to a stop by a pile of charred ashes.\nLu Sheng shook the blood off his saber blade.\nA frenzy of ecstasy arose in his heart.\n‘This is what it feels like to take a life. This is what it means to be a saber warrior! As the legends go… \"at the first word of discord, scores are settled by the saber\"!’\nHe gripped the long saber tightly. This ordinary silver-white long saber in his hand, with only a blade the length of a forearm, was like his closest comrade.\nA faint and strange feeling gushed up in his heart. All of a sudden, he felt as if he was personally being immersed in and experiencing all the wuxia novels that he had read in the past.\nAn indescribable passion burned in the depths of his heart.\n\"Come! Either kill me, or end up like the two pieces of trash on the ground.\"\nLu Sheng liked this feeling. His eyes red, he licked his dry lips as he approached Lin Hongshui step by step.\n\"You brat!!\"\nLin Hongshui burst into rage as his expression changed into a furious one.\nGripping his thick-backed broad saber with both his hands, he strode towards Lu Sheng.\n\"CHI!\"\nA silver swallow appeared suddenly again as Lu Sheng’s saber struck forward.\nDespite his Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade being only at the Initiated level, it displayed considerable might when employed with Lu Sheng’s mastery of the way of the saber, which had come from his training in the Black Tiger Saber Technique.\n\"DANG!\"\nHowever, this stroke was blocked by Lin Hongshui with a lift of his arm.\n\"I recognize this strike… Swallows Skirting the Water… so it’s Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade…\" he sneered viciously. \"In those days, I almost hacked the original master of this saber technique to death, so it’ll be easy to get rid of a little ass-brat like you!\"\nHe added some force, pushing Lu Sheng’s long saber away.\nThe broad saber’s blade flipped and slashed diagonally upwards with extreme force and velocity.\nThis stroke, Water-Splitting Move of Wind-Rippling Saber Technique, was one of his favorite trademark opening moves. Each time he used it, his opponent would either have to dodge or be forced to face him head-on.\nLu Sheng leapt aside, dodging the broad saber. He executed Eighty Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade at full strength with the long saber in his hand, clashing against his opponent.\nThe battle between the two escalated to a frenzy in the middle of the backyard.\nLin Hongshui’s saber strokes came thick and heavy like hammer strokes, full of extreme force. Whenever Lu Sheng came into contact with one, his arm would turn numb.\nBut Lu Sheng’s saber strokes came quicker and displayed superior stamina, often striking along the sides of his opponent’s strokes or parrying them aside with Eighty Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade.\nBoth actually struck with immense speed, incomparably quicker than Number Two and Number Three.\nBut for both of them, saberplay at this speed merely fell under normal conditions.\nIn one breath, Lu Sheng continuously executed the ten over moves of Eighty Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade in full, yet he still failed to gain the upper hand.\nLin Hongshui, on the other hand, remained as energetic as a tiger; his moves were still astonishingly strong.\n\"DANG, DANG!\"\nBoth sabers collided against each other twice in a row once again.\nLu Sheng’s foot twisted a trifle carelessly as he stepped onto a fragile plank of wood, resulting in him losing his balance.\nLin Hongshui’s eyes widened and his broad saber immediately slashed downwards with full might before him.\n\"Go and die!!!\"\nHe would cleave this terrible brat into two halves there and then! How dare he kill Number Two and Number Three right in front of him?\nIf he left this score unsettled, who would still dare to follow him in the future!?\nThe broad saber vibrated eccentrically as it slashed down towards Lu Sheng’s head viciously.\nThe core of Wind-Rippling Saber Technique’s mantra was precisely to significantly amplify the strength of broad saber strokes through a unique method of employing force.\nThis astonishingly bolstered the strength of Lin Hongshui’s saber strokes, which were already shockingly powerful to begin with.\nThe broad saber fell squarely towards Lu Sheng’s head.\n\"HOO!\"\nRight in that instant, Lu Sheng straightened his body and steadied himself in a second. The long saber in his hand vibrated at extreme speed, emitting a vague roar without warning.\n\"ROAR!!!\"\nIt was a tiger’s roar!\nLu Sheng’s eyes were dyed mildly red as he executed Tiger Kill of Black Tiger Saber Technique.\nCarrying powerful vibration and explosive force, the saber blade slashed towards Lin Hongshui’s saber-wielding arms. The speed of this stroke was far swifter and more vicious than that of the broad saber!\n\"Don’t you dare!!!\" An enraged roar sounded out from behind the gap in the wall all of a sudden.\nIn the blink of an eye, a ball-like black shadow shot forward and struck the side of Lu Sheng’s long saber.\n\"DANG!\"\nIt was a piece of ashen stone.\nA second muscular man, who was carrying a thick-backed broad saber, leapt into the yard.\nThis man’s face was sporting two intersecting scars which stretched from the forehead to the chin, giving him an extraordinarily savage look.\n\"Big bro!!\"\nEarlier, Lin Hongshui’s reaction was delayed by a bit due to the tremor induced by Black Tiger Saber Technique’s tiger roar; he nearly had both his arms lopped off by Lu Sheng.\nNow, he hurriedly withdrew his saber, giant beads of cold sweat breaking out on his face; he was clearly terrified.\n\"This brat is using Black Tiger Saber Technique; he’s not easy to deal with! There are more people coming. We’ll take him down together!\" Lin Shuanghuo said severely as he glanced at the two corpses beneath him.\n\"Alright!\"\nThe two brothers split up and charged towards Lu Sheng simultaneously.\nLu Sheng remained unfazed, executing Black Tiger Saber Technique’s Tiger Might. The strength of the saber stroke was now much heavier than that of Eighty Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade.\nThe might of Black Tiger Saber Technique at the level of full mastery was astonishing. Each stroke he made was one step earlier than either of theirs, slashing towards vital areas and thus forcing them to be on the defensive.\nIn the short span of a few breaths, he had continuously executed Tiger Might seventeen times!\n\"CHI CHI CHI CHI!\"\nShouts and yells rang out back and forth across the entire yard. Unexpectedly, the combined might of both brothers was merely enough to reach a draw against Lu Sheng!\nNever once did they have a chance to execute their saber strokes to the full; each time they were halfway in motion, they would be forced to retreat in defense.\nThe intense battle carried on for the duration of half a joss stick. Lin Shuanghuo had run out of patience. Exploiting an opportunity while his younger brother hung on temporarily, he took a step back, took out a paper sachet from his chest and hurled it towards Lu Sheng’s face.\n\"Just die!!!\"\n\"Poof!\"\nThe paper sachet was hacked into pieces by Lu Sheng’s saber, scattering large amounts of ash within.\nShocked, Lu Sheng quickly shut his eyes tightly.\nWithout time for further thoughts, he executed the final Tiger Roar madly.\n\"ROAR!!!\"\nYet another tiger’s roar rang out.\n\"DANG, DANG!\"\nThis time, Lu Sheng’s long saber could no longer avoid the two broad sabers, colliding head-on against them.\n\"KA-CHA!\"\nThe long saber broke apart, its blade spinning to the side before stabbing into the ground.\nHowever, as it was the most powerful move of Black Tiger Saber Technique, the strength and speed of Tiger Roar was not to be taken lightly.\nThe broad sabers, too, were shaken in Lin Hongshui and his brother’s hands as they loosened their grip.\n\"Now let’s see what you’ll block our attacks with! Go and die!! Hahaha!\"\nLin Shuanghuo laughed manically. A saber warrior without his saber was essentially a lamb ready to slaughter. The gap in strength was extremely wide.\nHe was about to tighten the grip on his saber to finish Lu Sheng off.\n\"BOOM BOOM!\"\nJust then, two low and deep palm strike sounds rang out.\nLin Shuanghuo’s eyes opened only to see Lu Sheng close by all of a sudden. Both his palms slammed into his younger brother Lin Hongshui’s chest one after another, lightning-quick.\nThe broad saber in Lin Hongshui’s hand dropped to the ground with a clang.\nHe fell two steps backwards in disbelief, clutching his chest and unable to speak.\n\"Big… Big Bro… get…out!\"\n\"PUUUU!\"\nLin Hongshui spat out a mouthful of blood and collapsed backwards.\nAt this moment, Lu Sheng had already entered a strange state of maniacal frenzy.\nAfter killing Lin Hongshui, he charged towards Lin Shuanghuo in a flash using Heart-Shattering Palm’s movement steps.\nAs if he had just awoken from a dream, Lin Shuanghuo roared in rage, intending to block his advance with his saber.\nBut he was too late.\nHis younger brother’s death had left him stunned for an instant. Just that moment’s delay was sufficient for Lu Sheng to come too close for his comfort.\n\"BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!!!\"\nWith a series of three palm strikes, Lu Sheng’s palms struck Lin Shuanghuo in his chest and abdomen thrice like a streak of lightning.\nThe Heart-Shattering Palm’s signature penetrative force went through the skin and muscles and straight to the organs.\nLin Shuanghuo’s face turned beetroot red. He retreated several steps, then collapsed onto his knees.\nHe glared at Lu Sheng unyieldingly and opened his mouth to speak. However, blood kept gushing out of his mouth, stopping his words as he choked.\n\"PUUUU!!!\"\nLin Shuanghuo collapsed stiffly forward. No sound was heard from him again.\nLu Sheng chuckled twice to himself.\n‘Two Strength-Proficiency experts… probably they’re Phantom Head Blade and Severed Head Blade that Uncle Zhao had hunted when he was young. To think that they’d die in my hands today…’\nStaring at the four corpses on the ground, his heart was momentarily washed over by a wave of ecstasy as Qi and blood surged all over within him.\n‘Could it be that this is the level of Intent-Proficiency that Uncle Zhao mentioned? As well as the martial arts intent that Master Zhang Xun advised me about previously?’\nIf Strength-Proficiency was the level of controlling and harnessing the entire body’s force and strength, then Intent-Proficiency was the use of sight, intent, sound and other means to attack the enemy on multiple fronts.\nAt the same time, the Intent-Proficiency level gave one a stronger command of one’s own physical force than the Strength-Proficiency level.\nAfter all, how could the muscles in the human body be so easy to thoroughly master?\nLu Sheng remembered that someone on Earth had once researched and discovered that if the strength of all the body’s muscles was gathered in one place, it would enable even an ordinary adult’s strike to attain the horrifying force of several metric-tons.\nTheoretically, that was the limit.\nBut the human skeletal system simply does not allow one to employ force of such magnitude.\nSo, it was just a theory.\nBut even then, Intent-Proficiency probably developed one’s muscles to a level incredibly close to that.\nLu Sheng stood in the yard and stepped forward to search the Lin brothers’ pouches and clothes.\nFrom their waist pouches, he fished out a stack of silver notes – each worth a hundred talents. He swiftly stuffed them into his own waist pouch without bothering to count them.\nThen, he obtained a worn black booklet, made of some unknown leather. The booklet was kept by Lin Shuanghuo close to his body and so was clearly very significant.\nLu Sheng left the rest of the mess untouched and rested quietly in the yard as he waited for Lu Manor’s men to arrive.\nActually, he too had suffered a few injuries from the battle with the two Strength-Proficiency experts.\nLin Shuanghuo and Lin Hongshui were both born with the natural gift of strength. Moreover, the Wind-Rippling Saber Technique increased that advantage of theirs, greatly amplifying the force behind their saber moves.\nIn that last head-on collision, the muscles in Lu Sheng’s right arm had also been concussed. His heels were also suffering from a dull ache – probably an injury incurred by his high-intensity explosion of power.\nNot to mention the throbbing pain coming from both his shoulders, caused by his continuous series of outbursts within a short period of time as well as saberplay at full strength. Add to that the final collision—perhaps he had injured his bones as well."}]}

So, his body’s rather tough. Family head, you need not worry.\"\nUncle Zhao said with a smile.\n\"At first, even I hadn’t expected that Brother Sheng would be that powerful. Those two were, after all, both experts whom I had tried but failed to arrest in my younger days. To think that, after all these years, they would fall into Brother Sheng’s hands.\"\nHe had seen their wounds. Both had died under Heart-Shattering Palm.\nHowever, he had no idea when Brother Sheng had mastered Heart-Shattering Palm; neither could he tell the extent of the skill behind those palm strikes.\nAfter all, the mastery of this skill could not be told just from looking at the surface.\n\"That’s for the best,\" Lu Quanan nodded. \"Everything’s fine. Back to normal. Let him get some rest and carry on with the plan to go learn martial arts in Mountain Edge City.\"\n\"Looking at Little Sheng’s moves, I’m sure he must be extremely passionate about martial arts. Otherwise, there’s no way that he would become so well-trained. So, I’m certain Little Sheng will be glad to hear that,\" Second Mother replied gently.\n\"Alright, alright. This was a false alarm. Everybody, go back to business. Little Qing will go back to reflect on herself. Stop wandering outside during this period. Just stay home!\" Lu Quanan gave the confinement order.\n\"Ok…\" Lu Qingqing too was scared out of her wits this time. Had her big brother come later by a minute, she would have been finished.\nShe needed time to recover emotionally as well.\n***\nNews of Lu Qingqing’s matter quickly spread throughout the entire Lu Manor like wildfire, spreading even to the other families in Nine Links City.\nAnd, so did Lu Sheng’s reputation as a martial arts fanatic.\nThese years, few knew of Phantom Head Blade brothers. Still, everyone learned of how Lu Sheng had arrested a few powerful fugitives with his sister and supposedly killed more than a few men.\nOnce this got out, Lu Sheng turned famous overnight.\nEveryone in the manor started to look at Lu Sheng differently.\nHe was someone who had taken the lives of powerful fugitives!\nEach time Lu Sheng was spotted, everyone feared him.\nAfter all, which fugitive who managed to resist capture for years didn’t have some tricks up his sleeves?\n\"That’s very normal,\" Lu Qingqing sat in Lu Sheng’s room, swinging both her legs back and forth and chewing on an apple in her hand.\nBecause of how she had nearly lost her modesty previously, she now no longer headed out every day.\nShe got used to hanging out in Lu Sheng’s room instead, attempting to persuade him to investigate the Xu family tragic case with her.\n\"Now in Lu Manor, apart from you, Big Bro, and a few martial arts masters like Uncle Zhao, those among the guards who have seen blood before are pathetically few in number. That’s how the servants used to look at me too,\" she seemed to have grown used to it. \"Speaking of which, if master and seniors knew that I had such a powerful big bro like you, I wonder what kind of expression they’d have… it’s fun even just imagining their faces!\"\nLu Qingqing laughed.\nGripping a brush, Lu Sheng was composedly practicing calligraphy.\n\"Brother Xu’s case should and must be investigated! It’s just not the right time yet,\" he said somberly.\n\"Brother Xu… died such a terrible death!\" Lu Qingqing’s eyes began to redden as she thought about that.\n\"Don’t worry. One day I’ll get to the bottom of this,\" Lu Sheng put his brush down and looked at the giant word sprawled across the paper: \"endure\".\nThe match against two Strength Proficiency experts this time gave him some awareness of where his limits lay.\nEvery single Strength Proficiency expert was someone not to be trifled with, possessing their own exclusive trademark skill. Needless to say, they were much more powerful than the average martial arts trainees.\nAlthough he had attained full mastery of both Black Tiger Saber Technique and Heart-Shattering Palm with the help of the Modifier, it wasn’t a simple matter of one plus one equals two for him to face off against two opponents at once.\nWhen two Strength Proficiency experts teamed up, their combined might was more than the sum of its parts. One must realize that it took twice as much energy to deal with them as when fighting against one.\nIf there was just one more Strength Proficiency expert who coordinated well with Lin Brothers, then he would have met his end there and then.\nLu Sheng pondered that.\nAlthough he did win this time, it was a narrow victory. In the end, even his saber had been broken and he had ended up with numerous wounds riddling his body.\n‘I guess I’m still too weak… In the Xu family tragic case, just the number of Strength Proficiency protectors amounted to four! Add to that the countless housemen and servants... to slaughter all of them without a sound within the span of a single night… that kind of power… just thinking of it gives me the chills.’\nOnce this thought surfaced, Lu Sheng felt that his own preparations were far, far too inadequate.\nHe needed stronger power, stronger martial arts!\n\"Big Bro, what’s on your mind? How about going shopping with me?\"\nLu Qingqing waved her hand in front of Lu Sheng’s face, anticipation shining in her eyes.\nEver since she was saved, she had become another person before Lu Sheng. Her temper had mellowed significantly, becoming gentler and more feminine.\n\"Qingqing, do you know of inner force?\"\nLu Sheng responded with a question instead of answering her.\n\"Inner force… I’ve heard master mention it,\" Lu Qingqing nodded. \"Inner force experts are different from us outer force practitioners. Their training is gradual and takes a long time. Normally, without three to five years of cultivation, they’re no different from an average person. Why do you ask, Big Bro?\"\n\"Your master… does he know any inner force experts?\" Since he was unable to locate Duanmu Wan, Lu Sheng intended to look for a breakthrough through Lu Qingqing.\n\"Well, he does know a few. Master has two good friends—both priests who cultivate life-force Qi skills,\" Lu Qingqing replied.\n\"Life-force Qi skills… are there those inner force experts with legitimate fighting skills?\"\n\"That… I’ve never heard of any.\"\nLu Qingqing’s reply left Lu Sheng disappointed. But it was also to be expected.\nEven the mysterious Duanmu Wan could produce no more than a few life-force Qi skills. Lu Qingqing’s master was merely an outer force expert with a bit of fame. The odds of him knowing inner force experts were slim.\n\"Why? Big Bro’s thinking of training inner force? I heard that stuff’s very iffy and time-consuming… the training process is fraught with risks and it’s not even very powerful. How can it be faster to attain or stronger in battle than outer force training? What’s the point?\" Lu Qingqing could not understand.\n\"I have my plans.\"\nLu Sheng began to form calculations in his mind.\nMountain Edge City. He did truly intend to go there, but with this matter arising, it really wasn’t a good time for him to leave Nine Links City—especially considering the great distance between the two cities.\nHis family in this present life has been very good to him; his old dad, second mum, Uncle Zhao and the others all treated him very well.\nHe would hate it if something were to happen to them while he was away.\nMoreover, in this time and age, if something really did happen, where could he hide and find refuge all by himself?\nLu Sheng also sensed that his old dad Lu Quanan was dispatching him to Mountain Edge City to draw him away from a certain something.\n\"A storm is coming…\" he heaved a long sigh. Looking at his naïve Second Sister Lu Qingqing, his heart suddenly felt heavy.\n‘If I really leave, perhaps I can hide from danger for a moment. But I can’t always be hiding. At the end of the day, I’ve still got to face it. I should quickly grow while the conditions at home are good and there’s no lack of money. Until I have the strength to protect myself—that’s the right path.’\nRoad to Mountain Edge City was really too long. Lu Sheng already had other plans.\nInner-plus-outer training—integrating inner force and outer force—that was the best direction towards great power which came to his mind now.\nSuddenly, he recalled the secret manual that he had burnt a hole in his pocket to obtain—the incomplete Black Fury Skill.\n‘Although it’s incomplete, it’s the only manual I have in my hands right now. To heck with it.’\nListening to Lu Qingqing’s incessant chatter beside him about the interesting trivia from her days as her master’s disciple, Lu Sheng began recalling Black Fury Skill’s force movement routes silently.\nHe had previously spent quite a period of time practicing Black Fury Skill and so remembered the Level One Initiation mantra.\nSeeing that Lu Sheng was distracted, Lu Qingqing left in disappointment after going on for a while.\nLittle Qiao entered after that to bring Lu Sheng a pail of water to wash his face. Then, she served him his medicine.\nLu Sheng did not say a word at that time. He kept his focus entirely on Black Fury Skill’s intent routes while performing those tasks.\nA guess formed in his mind. The reason why it was so difficult to learn Black Fury Skill could have been because, like Jade Crane Skill, there was supposed to have been an initial Qi movement diagram added to it.\nJade Crane Skill’s Qi movement diagram was an immortal crane with its wings stretched out, about to fly.\nPerhaps Black Fury Skill had something like that too, just that it wasn’t in the manual.\n‘That diagram’s like an overview, coordinating the entire body’s inner Qi movement routes.’\nToo bad he had too few materials on inner force with him and was thus unable to conduct a systematic research and come up with any reasoned theories.\nHis only option was to just remain focused on practicing Black Fury Skill while nursing his wounds.\nIn the blink of an eye, several days had passed again.\nYet another strange incident occurred in Nine Links City.\nSomebody had discovered a child’s graffiti on the perimeter wall of a side yard on the city’s outskirts.\nThe graffiti looked like it was drawn with charcoal. Some people kept watch over the wall to see whose kid was so mischievous.\nUnexpectedly, within a night, more graffiti was mysteriously added to the perimeter wall, undetected by anyone. However, not a single soul had been spotted.\nThe Xu family massacre, the Wang Villa well incident, the missing hunters… and now this mysterious graffiti on the wall.\nThis series of incidents had everyone in Nine Links City like cats on hot bricks.\nSomeone even reported that he heard a blood-curdling scream from outside the city. He mustered up his courage and ventured out to take a look, only to see signs of a fight between ferocious beasts and traces of blood left on the ground.\nHowever, the prefectural yamen announced the order to cancel the request for assistance.\nOne morning, Lu Quanan had been summoned to the prefectural yamen with the same three family heads as usual.\nWhen he came back, his face looked foul.\nLu Sheng inquired about it but he kept silent, remarking only that there was a conflict with the Prefect which made everyone unhappy.\nThereafter, Lu Quanan made contact with Lu Sheng’s uncle, Lu Anping—the deputy commander of the garrison.\nIn all these years, the reason why the Lu family had been able to hold their own was not only thanks to Lu Quanan alone. Eldest Uncle Lu Anping was also a strong pillar that held up the family.\nBoth of them conversed in the study behind closed doors for a long time before finally emerging from inside.\nThen, someone spotted the eldest uncle leaving Lu Manor hurriedly.\nAlthough he resting and cultivating in his own room, Lu Sheng was continuously observing the situation in the prefectural yamen through Lu Qingqing and Little Qiao. Not to mention, second mother, fifth mother, Lu Yingying, Uncle Zhao… and all others would visit him very now and then.\nAt this moment, all of Nine Links City apart from the Lu Manor gave Lu Sheng a sense of living with a sword of Damocles hanging over his head.\nJust then, Uncle Zhao sent someone over, saying that Little Eight’s whereabouts had been discovered. He had fainted in one of the houses along that street. By the time he was found, he had been starved to a bag of skin and bones.\n\"Little Eight? Did he say what happened to him? Why was he left alone in that house?\" Lu Sheng asked.\nThe one who came to pass on the message was a guard under Uncle Zhao’s command; he shook his head.\n\"He didn’t say much. He just kept repeating that he rushed over that day as fast as he could. But not long after entering that street, he suddenly fainted. When he came to, he saw us.\"\nLu Sheng frowned. \"Is that true?\"\n\"True. Uncle Zhao has already confirmed that other sources corroborated with his testimony. It was indeed as Little Eight said.\"\n\"Then that’s strange…\"\nLu Sheng shook his head.\n\"You may leave first.\"\n\"Yes.\" The guard left swiftly.\nIn the courtyard in front of his room, Lu Sheng paced around.\nHis wounds had long since more or less recovered. Now, he was just practicing Black Fury Skill, awaiting the moment he would be able to sense Qi.\nAs long as a thread of Qi was sensed by him, he would rapidly upgrade the inner force skill. He was bent on truly making Black Fury Skill a part of his strength.\nJust then, Lu Quanan hurriedly entered the yard with two housemen trailing after him.\n\"Sheng’er, you’ve rested quite a while. How about setting off today?\"\nLu Quanan’s face was calm and serene. In his hand was a black silk bundle, which was the money for the journey that he had prepared for Lu Sheng."}]}

The Lu Manor was one of the houses there.\nThe horse carriage headed straight down Ku Rong Street and entered into a garden area.\nThis area was surrounded by greyish-white stone walls, forming a huge oval shape.\nOn the left of the area was where the Lu Manor was located.\nThe manor was the very image of quiet and tranquility, with black doors flanked by red lanterns and two stone chimeras, now covered with a white layer of snow.\nThe horse carriage stopped at the entrance of the Lu Manor, where Lu Sheng alighted. People within the mansion had long since heard the sound of him approaching and unhurriedly opened the doors. A chamberlain awaited at the entrance.\nAs soon as Lu Sheng and Little Qiao passed through the doors, they saw a good-looking man and a woman standing together on a stone bridge to the right of the residence.\nThe man was dashing, confident and with a brilliant countenance. He had sharp brows and sparkling eyes, and there was a thick aura of a Confucian scholar around him.\nThe woman looked soft and gentle, her eyes beautiful as if taken from a painting. She had slender waist and long legs; her manner was that of a well-bred girl from a wealthy family.\nSeeing the two of them, Lu Sheng’s train of thought was briefly interrupted. His mood lifted somewhat, and took the initiative to go over to greet them.\n\"Elder Brother Xu, why are you here only today? My little cousin has missed you for the past days,\" he smiled as he walked on the stone bridge.\nThe man smiled as he turned and caught sight of Lu Sheng. \"So it’s Young Master Sheng. Earlier, I had to follow orders to investigate into something, a case which had just been resolved. I came to see Yiyi as soon as I could. Don’t blame me for this, I couldn’t disobey orders from the higher ups.\"\n\"A case? Has there recently been a case so big that Elder Brother Xu needed to personally take care of it?\" Lu Sheng knew that Elder Brother Xu Daoran was of a high position.\nHe was a County Lord who was overall in charge of law and order in all of the counties within Nine Links City area.\nThe position of a County Lord was second only to that of the County Magistrate, and was akin to that of a Police Commissioner.\n\"Just some cases in the fishing villages, but they’ve been resolved,\" Xu Daoran smiled warmly. \"Although, Little Sheng, when are you coming to help me? You promised me previously that you would come to help me out in planning for the city’s law and order.\"\nHow could Lu Sheng remember everything this body’s previous host had promised in the past? He gave a perfunctory laugh and hurried to change the subject.\n\"Fishing villages? Don't tell me it has to do with the rumored water ghost?\"\n\"What water ghost! It was just a lunatic driven to madness by his desire for revenge who went on a killing spree. I have already beheaded him at the scene!\" Xu Daoran shook his head and said indifferently. \"The case has been resolved, let’s not dampen our spirits by harping on these matters. Little Sheng, do you still remember what I promised Yiyi previously?\"\n\"To offer joss-sticks in Red Lotus Temple, and take a hike while you’re at it?\" Lu Sheng swiftly replied with a smile.\n\"You sure remember these play things very well,\" Xu Daoran helplessly replied and added, \"You’re no longer young… nineteen-year-old this year, was it? You should find some work to do. You can't expect to live the rest of your life like this, can you?\"\nHe had watched Lu Sheng grow up. Because their families had been long-time friends, he had always seen Lu Sheng as his younger brother.\nNow, he felt that he had to offer a few words of advice.\nLu Sheng shook his head and laughed. \"Elder Brother Xu, do you want me to become an official, or a businessman?\"\n\"An official, of course. This is also your father’s wish. Your maternal and paternal uncles both hope that you can come over and help them as soon as possible. After all, you’re the eldest son of the Lu family,\" Xu Daoran persuaded.\n\"Let’s not talk about this first. It’s not urgent, not urgent at all! I’m still young. What logic is there behind this hurry to chase the eldest son out?\" Unconcerned, Lu Sheng replied randomly in a casual tone.\nXu Daoran and Lu Yiyi were both speechless, and did not continue the topic.\nLu Sheng did not want to dwell on the subject of being an official. He changed the subject, and walked off with Little Qiao in the direction of his sleeping quarters.\nOnce he got there, he changed his clothes. Without even going to greet his father, he then took the piece of cobblestone and went alone to the garden at the back of the manor.\nXu Daoran was born in the Xu family which, like the Lu family, was one of the most illustrious families in this northern city that is Nine Links. Their members had far-reaching influence, and held important positions in all areas of the city.\nLu Sheng felt rather kindly disposed towards Xu Daoran; he was a sincere and honest guy, without selfish motives, and was genuinely interested in Yiyi.\nTo Lu Sheng, he was as close as an elder brother.\nExcept…\nLu Sheng grasped onto the cobblestone, once again thinking back to the earlier scene. He thought back to what he had incidentally heard at the city gates, about how the water ghost had been killed.\n‘In this world, are there ghosts and immortals…?’\nThere was a faint, indescribable gloom in his heart as he gazed at the snow swirling in the garden.\n‘Perhaps it’s just as Elder Brother Xu said... it’s just a false rumor spread by the people,’ he shook his head, grasping onto a thread of wishful thinking in his heart.\nEarly in the evening, he returned to his room to wash and sleep. The day’s events had left him befuddled. With so many things on his mind, he quickly grew tired.\nHe slept through the night, up until sunrise.\n\"DONG DONG DONG! DONG DONG DONG!\"\nThe sound of frantic knocks arose.\nLu Sheng abruptly opened his eyes, shot up from the bed and looked towards the door.\n\"Who is it?!\"\n\"Young Master...! There’s been trouble...!\" It was Little Qiao’s voice.\nLu Sheng hurriedly got off his bed to open the door. Outside, Little Qiao stood there with a terrifyingly pale face, devoid of all color. The fat cheeks on her baby face were currently trembling uncontrollably.\n\"Xu… Xu… Xu…\"\nSeeing this, an ominous sense of crisis began to rise in Lu Sheng’s heart.\n\"Just what happened? Take a deep breath!\" He raised his hand to pat Little Qiao’s back vigorously.\nOnly then was Little Qiao able to breathe normally.\n\"The Xu family… Lord Xu’s family’s all finished!!\" She said in one breath, sobbing.\nLu Sheng was stupefied.\nLittle Qiao speedily helped Lu Sheng into his outer robes. Without saying another word, they both sped towards the outer manor.\nThe patriarch of the Lu family, Lu Fang, was standing outside the manor. He had his hands behind his back, a hint of a tremble on his crestfallen face.\nThree huge black double horse carriages waited next to him.\nLu Sheng, along with his other cousins within the manor, hastily paid respects to Lu Fang before promptly boarding the carriages.\nLu Fang and Lu Sheng sat together, father and son both silent as they faced each other. Neither spoke a word while on the carriage.\nLu Fang was over sixty years of age. With a white beard, skinny build and handsome features, he looked more like a distinguished scholar rather than a businessman.\nThe horse carriages advanced without slowing down. It wasn't long till they arrived outside the Nine Links City’s gates.\nLu Sheng alighted from the carriage, and was shocked by the scene before his eyes.\nTo the left of the carriageway outside the city gates, ten corpses lay neatly on the snow. From young to old, from men to women… they were all of the Xu family!\nAll of them were clad in robes custom-made for the Xu household. Xu Daoran lay in the middle of the third row.\nHis face was ashen, his body stiff and eyes shut tightly. His expression was one of extreme fear, just as if he had seen something immensely terrifying before his death.\nLu Sheng saw the constables maintaining order at the scene. He saw his own father, Lu Fang, standing in front of an old man’s corpse, not saying a word with his fists clenched tightly.\nThe Prefect, having heard the news, was also present, his face as white as the snow surrounding them.\nLu Sheng took a deep breath and walked slowly to stand next to a constable. \"How did they die?\"\nThat constable recognized him and knew who he was. He sighed.\n\"All of them died in their own manor, hung by seaweed from the house beams. No idea where the seaweed came from…\"\n\"Yiyi! Yiyi!!\"\nA cry of alarm suddenly sounded out from behind. Obviously, little cousin Yiyi had fainted.\nLu Sheng heaved a deep sigh, recalling what Xu Daoran had said to him only the day before.\nHe had just returned from solving cases in the fishing villages…\nFishing villages…\nWater ghost…\nThat bizarre piece of cobblestone…\nIn that moment, many thoughts went through Lu Sheng’s mind.\nIn actuality, he had only been in this world for a couple of days, and did not have any deep attachment to Xu Daoran. Therefore, he only felt a sense of regret and shock at the moment. However, he did not feel the grief others would have expected of him.\nIt’s not that he had never seen corpses before.\nRather, it’s just that he had never seen this many corpses before.\n\"Where is Priest Chi Ling of the Xu household?\" He heard Lu Fang asking the senior constable.\n\"In another area. The corpse has been split into many chunks, one of which has even been gnawed at by a beast…\" the senior constable replied in a low voice.\nA spell of silence.\nBe it the Lu family, the Prefect or the commoners looking on from the city gates, they were all silent.\n\"Priest Chi Ling is quick with his sword, and is even a cut above Uncle Zhao…\" Lu Fang gradually lowered his voice.\nUncle Zhao was the strongest martial arts master employed by the Lu family. Priest Chi Ling was stronger than Uncle Zhao, and yet he was killed.\nThis was no longer a simple murder case, but a grave danger that was enough to threaten everyone present!\nOf all the people present, who would dare say that he was mightier than the Xu family?\nNo one would dare say so, not even the Prefect.\nLu Sheng stood silently on the roadside. He’d initially thought that this world was very safe and was but an imitation of the ancient China, that’s all. There were some surprising occurrences, but nothing too serious.\nBut now, it seemed…\nHe touched the cobblestone that was in his sleeve pocket.\nThe cobblestone was shockingly hot at the moment.\nHe took out the cobblestone, hesitated for a bit, and then lightly threw it away.\nThis item might just bring calamity upon him.\nThe Xu family had a foundation as robust as his own Lu family, and yet was entirely wiped out in the span of a single night.\nThis caused Lu Sheng to be greatly alarmed in his heart.\nHe deliberated, and suddenly walked over to the right of the cobblestone, bent over, and picked it up.\n\"Psss.\"\nUnknowingly, his forefinger had been accidentally cut by wild grass jutting out from the snow-covered ground.\nIt was a special kind of grass. The sides of its leaves were sharp as the edge of a blade.\nLu Sheng’s finger was immediately sliced and bled, a few drops of blood dripping onto the cobblestone.\n\"Young Master?\" Little Qiao followed closely behind him, somewhat anxious, with tears streaming down her small face. Clearly, Xu Daoran’s death was a huge blow to her.\nLu Sheng’s body was frozen on the spot.\nA series of extremely unique syllables suddenly floated across his mind.\n\"Welcome to the Deep Blue Skills Cheating Device.\"\nIn a moment, Lu Sheng’s eyes went into a daze. Quite a while passed before he was back to himself.\nHe stared at the translucent, bluish square frame floating before his eyes. Astonishingly, in it he could see his name and all skills he currently mastered.\n‘Isn’t this… the little cheating device I wrote for a mobile phone app?!’\nLu Sheng felt like he was going mad, having one hallucination after another.\nIt was bad enough that he had been reincarnated into this Young Master of a wealthy family, who barely had the strength to truss a chicken. As if that wasn’t enough, he was actually having all sorts of hallucinations now!\nIn his previous life, he had downloaded a little game called Chronicles of Flying Swords and Heroes when he was bored. However, because the game was too difficult, he had programmed a simple cheating device to modify his martial arts in the game.\nHe had named it the Deep Blue Cheating Device. Come to think of it, the voice he had heard earlier was his own, recorded through a voice-changing device.\nNever did he expect…\nLu Sheng looked resolutely into the space within the square frame.\nThe space was remarkably simple.

Borrowing the momentum from the huge impact, the long-hilted saber swept away the oncoming black shadow.\n\"BAM!\"\nThe black shadow slammed into the ground, rolled over a few times and emitted a pained growl. The torch cast its light onto it now that it appeared in its range.\nIt was a wild wolf! Its waist had been cut wide open by his saber!\nBefore he could think about it further, two other wild wolves pounced towards him from the dark.\nHis body reacted in the first second by instinct.\nTilting the long-hilted saber leftwards, he blocked one of the wild wolves with its long hilt. Then, with a swing of his body, he threw that wolf onto the other beast.\n\"Bang!\"\nThese two effortful motions left him wanting in strength. He was but a frail and skinny rich man’s kid not too long ago, after all.\nThe two wild wolves were thrown into the distance, hurt.\nPanting heavily and red-eyed, Lu Sheng lifted his saber and unleashed a Tiger Kill on the nearest wild wolf!\nThe blade sliced down from above, inclining slightly. His wrists vibrated vigorously – they shook thrice continuously, as per the rate dictated by the mantra.\n\"Whoosh!\"\nThe roar of a fierce tiger seemed to ring in the air.\nStruck with fear, the two wild wolves trembled and their movements lapsed by a beat.\nAt that instant, light flashed across the blade of the long-hilted saber. One of the beasts was beheaded on the spot with a clean saber stroke.\nThe tip of the saber had also nicked the other wolf’s neck, and blood was rapidly seeping out of it.\nLu Sheng mustered up his strength and struck again. This time, it was Tiger Might.\nHis forearm vibrated four times, employing a different level of force each time. The strength of his entire body was channeled into the saber.\nTiger Might emphasized speed more than Tiger Kill did, compromising slightly on strength in return. Nonetheless, it wasn’t something the fragile neck of a mere wild wolf could withstand.\nBefore the wolf could dodge, it was struck squarely in the neck by the long-hilted saber that sped up drastically without warning.\n\"Splat!\"\nThe wolf’s head fell on the ground.\nLu Sheng sucked in huge mouthfuls of air, panting heavily.\nThe continuous series of big movements had left a layer of sweat on his face.\n\"HOWL…\"\nOne more wild wolf remained – the one which went for the meat.\nNow, it went around a rock, its two green eyes staring furiously at Lu Sheng.\n‘My body’s too weak after all…’ Frustration gathered in Lu Sheng’s heart.\nHowever, his face remained impassive. He understood that when facing off against a wild beast, one must never back off or show even a hint of fear.\n\"Eh!?\"\nBoth his eyes opened wide in a stare as he glared fiercely at the wolf.\nThe last wild wolf focused its stare on him for a moment longer before slowly retreating backwards. Finally, it completely slipped into the darkness.\nOnly then did Lu Sheng breathe in relief.\nActually, his stamina was almost completely spent. Both his arms were sore and weak, even to the point of trembling when grasping his saber.\nIf that wild wolf had really pounced on him... while he was certain that he would survive, he wouldn’t remain unscathed either.\nHe waited till he was sure that the wild wolf had really left. Then, Lu Sheng retrieved the torch and left hurriedly in the direction of Nine Links City.\nWith this trip, he now knew where he stood.\nUncle Zhao had once mentioned his glorious past in connection with the wild wolves outside the city.\nAfter achieving full mastery of his saberplay in his youth, he had once been surrounded and attacked by three wild wolves. Armed with nothing but a single-handed saber, he slaughtered all three wolves at the cost of a mild injury to his forearm.\nThis had already set a terrific battle score.\nThe wild wolves in this world were completely different from those that Lu Sheng knew.\nTheir bodies were larger – each one much larger than the wild wolves on Earth. They were much stronger as well.\nAlmost the same as the big golden retrievers people kept as pets. [1]\nAnother difference between wild wolves here and on Earth was that those here gathered in packs of three to five. Very rarely would there be large packs of them.\nLu Sheng jogged back to the city gates. When the light of the torches on the city walls came into view, he felt a sense of relief.\nRolling up the clothes on him, he hid the blood-stained spots and his long-hilted sabre, took out his travel pass, and strode towards the city gates.\n***\n\"Brother Sheng, Brother Sheng, listen to me! This ain’t ordinary stuff. Right after reaching Zi Hua City, I had people bring it here from over there.\nRumor has it that in the Central Plains it is considered the Number One Legendary Stone. Countless merchants and nobles bid and fought for it. Finally, in an accident, it fell into the river and the waves brought it to Zi Hua River. Then it was fished out of the waters by the fishermen of Zi Hua City.\nI can’t tell you the twists and turns of this story in just a few words. If not for…\"\n\"Do I look like a fool to you?\" Lu Sheng gently waved his fan and looked at a fatso before him with a faint smile.\nThis fatso was called Zheng Xiangui. He was the second son of the boss of the Precious & Famous Auction House in Nine Links City.\nAs well as Lu Sheng’s best friend from his past.\nLu Sheng and he grew up as brothers from another mother. They clicked impeccably with each other and went through all troubles together, sharing thick and thin. [2]\nIt’s just that Zheng Xiangui had a bad habit. It was his tendency to wallow in greed.\nIn his own words, he would say that even biological brothers had to keep clear scores, otherwise their relationship would sour sooner or later.\nBoth of them were sitting in Goldfish Restaurant’s Peony Room. A well-endowed lady dressed in pink sat beside the fatso, reclining in his arms.\nThis lad was now staring at Lu Sheng with a pained expression.\n\"Brother Sheng, now that’s where you’re wrong. Your brother here took great pains to find a rare treasure. And now here he is, giving you the opportunity to bid for it in private before it gets auctioned. It’s fine if you don’t value it, but how can you ridicule me?\" Fatso pointed at Lu Sheng, looking as if he was immensely grieved.\n\"Alright, alright. Don’t pull that trick on me. Have you gotten news about the martial arts manuals I’m looking for?\" Lu Sheng continued to ask.\nHe came looking for this blood brother of his in order to gather more martial arts manuals.\nOne Black Tiger Saber Technique was not enough. Not even close.\nHe finally understood the chances of survival out in the wild an expert like Uncle Zhao had.\nNo wonder he had never heard of anyone journeying out in the distance alone. Out in the wilderness, wild beasts were abundant. For anyone to venture out all by himself was to court death.\nEven Uncle Zhao, Zhao Dahu, famous in Nine Links City, was able to deal with just three wild wolves on his own. Maybe four, at the very most. Any more and even the Nine Links City’s supposedly top-notch expert would have to surrender.\n\"With stuff like martial arts manuals, it’s hard to tell genuine apart from fake. Not only that, many of them have hidden snares within them. Even if they were genuine, some of the methods written inside will lead to lifelong handicaps if you make even a small mistake and practice them for long. What do you want this for, Brother Sheng? Without a master to guide you, there’s no use no matter how many manuals you buy,\" Zheng Xiangui asked out of curiosity, rubbing his white jade thumb ring.\n\"You’re quite in-the-know.\" Lu Sheng chuckled. \"I naturally have my uses for them. Don’t bother yourself with that, just find me a few to begin with.\"\nZheng Xiangui shrugged. \"Well, I guess there are a few. Two martial arts manuals were deposited for sale by a client just recently. We’ve gotten a master to examine them. They should be genuine. But without a master, nobody dares to practice them.\"\n\"What’s the asking price?\" Lu Sheng asked straightforwardly.\n\"Hey hey, Brother Sheng, with this special relationship going on between the two of us, why act so polite?\" Zheng Xiangui started giggling like a woman.\n\"Can you stop being so disgusting?\" Lu Sheng was speechless. \"Name a price, come on, I’m in a hurry.\"\n\"I can only sell you one. The other one has been reserved by another VIP,\" Zheng Xiangui said with a smile.\n\"One will do. Did you bring it?\" Lu Sheng raised his eyes.\n\"Brother Sheng understands me well after all. Seeing how you were going after it, I directly brought it over,\" Zheng Xiangui took out a thin grey booklet.\n\"This manual doesn’t have any moves. It’s simply a special strength technique. One price, a hundred talents!\"\n\"Let me take a look first,\" Lu Sheng stretched out his hand.\nA hundred talents was equivalent to ten thousand dollars. This fatso also really dared to ask.\nFatso chuckled and placed the booklet in his hand. Taking the manual over, Lu Sheng flipped through it and read in detail.\nThis manual seemed like it was part of a larger book from which it was ripped. It so happened to contain some content on strength.\nLooking at its contents, the cultivated strength was termed Jade Force.\nAccording to the manual, full mastery of the skill allowed one to begin accumulating force from all over the body right from the very first move. The accumulated force, once completed, could raise one’s striking speed and strength explosively by a great margin.\nLu Sheng looked at it. Its technique didn’t seem to overlap with the Black Tiger Saber Mantra and so could be stacked with it.\nBut he was not looking for this.\nHe was looking for those inner force Qi skills – manuals which could strengthen his physique and mind.\nFrom the pathetic state he landed himself in after using the Modifier once, he could tell that he needed to improve his physique in order to reduce the aftereffects of using the Modifier.\n\"Do you have those legendary inner force Qi manuals?\"\n\"Inner force Qi manuals?\" Zheng Xiangui rubbed his chin.\n\"Brother Sheng, you got me in a fix now. If there really was such stuff in the market, not to mention whether they’re real or fake, they’d be snatched up in the blink of an eye.\"\n\"You yourself said that it’s hard to distinguish real from fake. You should have copies of such in your family warehouse, right?\"\nLu Sheng, too, was in-the-know. A business like an auction house would certainly make a copy of the manuals they release for auction to keep as surviving copies.\nHaving run an auction house for so many years, the Zheng family must have had accumulated more than a few such copies.\n\"Oh, those… Brother Sheng. Even I cannot guarantee that there’s any one genuine among them.\nIf only one in a hundred is real, we’ll be lucky. Until today, no one has been able to cultivate any Qi from them. You sure you want them?\" Zheng Xiangui hesitated. \"As your brother, I’ll give you a piece of advice: don’t play with those surviving copies. If anything goes awry, you’ll damage your body and there are no means to fix that.\"\n\"You’ve got a way to find them?\"\nLu Sheng raised his brows. Fatso’s expression was a familiar one to him. Each time he displayed such an expression, it meant that he did know an answer, but was hesitating whether or not he should say it.\n\"Well, I’ve got a way… Brother Sheng, the kind of a manual you want… there indeed is one like that in this upcoming auction,\" an awkward expression appeared on Zheng Xiangui’s face.\n\"Why didn’t you say so earlier?\" Lu Sheng’s brows twitched.\n\"It’s not that your brother didn’t want to say. It’s that this stuff is going to be placed on auction in the Black Meeting…\"\n\"Black Meeting?\" Lu Sheng understood instantly.\nA Black Meeting was an anonymous auction during which clients hid their faces and names. The items brought out for auction were also often \"unclean\"; more than one of them was something blood was spilt over as well.\nThose who liked to attend the Black Meeting were mostly those who lived on the edge and were dangerous gangsters.\n\"Can you arrange for me to attend?\" Lu Sheng, however, had made up his mind to attend.\nNo average gangster would dare to provoke the Lu Manor anyway.\nJust counting strong housemen, the Lu family had thirty or forty of them. Not to mention several experts like Uncle Zhao among the ranks of its estate guards.\nOld Master Lu Quanan also possessed inseparable connections with the yamen authorities and could expect the help of the army when he encountered trouble.\nWith a powerful family background like that, he really needed not fear any ordinary gangsters.\n[1] ED/N: The only Chinese subspecies of wolves that would barely fit the bill is the Mongolian wolf, being roughly the same or barely smaller compared to golden retrievers (unless there’s something I missed). Most other wolves like the Tibetan wolf or the wolves in the West are much bigger. Maybe the author meant St. Bernard or a similar dog breed?

He could hear a young girl speak in a soft and gentle voice beside him.\nOutside the carriage was a sea of buzz and commotion. Hawkers were trying to sell their goods, people were yelling and others exclaiming. Children were making a din.\nLu Sheng heaved a deep sigh.\nHe knew he could no longer go back. He was originally a seasoned player in a state-owned enterprise. However, he’d gotten drunk, and when he woke up from his stupor, he found himself in this present world.\nIt had been five days since then.\nHe sniffed at the air, smelling a wafting aroma of wine, mixed with the fragrance of pies and fried nuts.\n\"Sigh… The Osmanthus Winery’s white osmanthus wine is getting more and more fragrant,\" the personal servant girl in the carriage, Little Qiao, whispered in a childish voice.\nLittle Qiao was only twelve this year, but with her natural dollish features and petite figure, she looked no different from a ten-year-old.\nHer small, chubby face carried a natural blush. She donned a small green cotton skirt and her hands were now rubbing a hair tie she was preparing to tie up Lu Sheng’s hair with when they alighted.\nThis kind of hair tie was made of the expensive bark of a species of rubber tree which emanated a light fragrance. The only bad thing about it was that it stiffened when the weather got cold and needed to be warmed and softened by rubbing it with warm hands.\nLu Sheng laughed and kept silent. Meanwhile, the carriage quickly came to a stop.\nHe pulled back the carriage’s veil and alighted, stepping onto the greyish white street covered with bluestone tiles, each as big as a face basin.\nOn the street, carriages and horses led by people travelled in either direction. Hawkers chatted with ladies who were out on a stroll, and wives appeared in public and laughed without care or restraint, peals of laughter resounding incessantly on the street.\nLu Sheng raised his head and saw the winery ahead. On a white rectangular signboard, three giant words danced – The Osmanthus Winery.\n\"Young Master Lu, you’re here! Come in, please! Room A has been reserved for you!\" A servant greeted them with a welcoming smile.\nLu Sheng nodded. From Little Qiao’s hands, he received a silver-bordered white paper fan and shook it open like a rich young master. A scenery of mountains and a river intertwined with each other was painted onto the fan, and a poem had been written on the side. It was clearly the work of a great literati.\nHe followed the servant into the familiar winery.\nIt was divided into two stories. The hall on the first story was presently filled with many of those who were listening to song performances.\nA young lady dressed in green stood in the middle of the empty space, her clear voice twisting and turning melodiously. Beside her, a middle-aged woman was playing a lute.\nThe song being performed was called Three Meetings, a tragic love story about a general on a mission of conquest and a fox lady in the mountain wilderness.\nBut it was a shame that those present were a boorish bunch, and only few somewhat cultured ones among them were barely able to understand the song. The rest of them treated the two ladies like thin air.\nThose who tipped were even fewer.\nLu Sheng paused. Seeing how lively it was, he sat down on an empty seat on the first story.\n\"Who picked Three Meetings?\" He asked the servant casually.\nHe held an uncommon status here in The Osmanthus Winery. Had it been an upscale place of entertainment on Earth, he would have been a VVIP guest: a patron whose annual spending was at least in five digits.\nIn a small northern city like this Nine Links City, such spending was enough to make one a VVIP customer.\n\"It’s Young Master Zhou. Young Master Zhou Que,\" the servant replied softly.\nNot intending to make things difficult for him, Lu Sheng dismissed him with a wave of his hand.\nAfter pulling Little Qiao down onto a seat, his gaze swept the crowd on the first story and quickly landed on a pale and frail gentleman clad in white robes. He was fanning himself lightly with an ugly gold fan he held in his hand.\n\"I bet he’s targeting that young girl who’s singing,\" Lu Sheng shook his head.\n\"Young Master just warned him last time. That lad’s really a rotten egg!\" Little Qiao pouted angrily. [1]\nLu Sheng smiled and no longer said anything. He started listening to the song quietly.\nDishes soon filled the top of the mahogany table. Lu Sheng grabbed some stir-fried meat slices with lettuce and started eating.\nHe also drank a mouthful of white osmanthus wine, drinking it as if it were a normal beverage. The faint and sweet floral fragrance mixed up in it made it taste like fruit juice.\n‘Food and clothing fit for royalty, without any lack or want, and I’ve even got a pretty servant girl to warm my bed… this lifestyle is way too decadent,’ sometimes, Lu Sheng would think about simply living the rest of his life this way. The pursuit of his previous life was to eat, drink and laze around anyway.\nHe ate another mouthful of dishes, and drank another mouthful of wine. Then, he opened his mouth so Little Qiao could put in a salted ice prawn she had just shelled.\nThose ice prawns were the local specialty of this snowy northern city. Just a casual scoop in a thick ice hole would draw up a large amount of translucent prawns.\nThose were ice prawns.\nThey were half the length of a normal prawn but were a fresh delicacy. The meat melted instantly in one’s mouth, serving up an indescribable gastronomic pleasure.\nOf course, it was extremely pricey.\nIt was already considered extravagant for an average person to eat it once a month. Who could enjoy it during every meal like him?\nLu Sheng enjoyed the delicacies and wine before him while listening to the song, but his mind was elsewhere.\nHe had already arrived in this ancient China-like world for so many days. Yet, according to his observations, this world was riddled with many strange happenings.\nInitially, he’d thought that he had gone back into the ancient times, but later he discovered otherwise.\nThe customs, the habits, the weather and the climate here were all vastly different from those during the times of any other dynasty or in any place that he knew of.\nAs he was thinking of these things, the winery’s main doors opened again.\nA group of muscular men dressed in short robes filed in, finding a table near the corner and sitting down immediately.\nThese muscular men were clearly not locals. Their dressing indicated that they seemed to have come from the Central Plains. Neither their clothing nor bearing were as rough as the northerners.\n\"Ai…\"\nThe leader among them was a bald man with bronze earrings and a fierce-looking face. Yet here he was, sighing.\n\"The days are getting worse.\"\n\"Don’t worry, big brother. If we can’t go past Lee Village, we’ll just take the second route. Skirting around Zhang Village will work, too,\" another man said with a frown.\n\"What do you know? I came to meet up with you guys precisely via that route. They’re not much better off than the people at Lee Village… there’s plenty of dead there too,\" the bald man’s fierce-looking face trembled and turned even more sorrowful.\n\"What on earth happened? Tell us big brother, so we can learn a thing or two,\" a man urged.\nThe bald muscular man sighed again. \"I don’t know the specifics either. I just know that quite a few fishing villages by the Sui Yang Lake have been affected. Seems like a water ghost has been haunting them.\"\n\"Water ghost!? No way!\"\nLu Sheng’s table was not far from them and he could hear their conversation which they made no effort to conceal.\nAt first, he was simply listening for fun, but little did he expect that those men started chatting about some superstitious things.\nThe Lu family in his present life was one of the several most wealthy families in this snowy northern city. Saying that they lived high off the hog would be an understatement.\nIf it was on Earth, they would be at least billionaires.\nDuring those past few days, coming out for a drink, he had heard more than a few rumors about demons, spirits, gods and ghosts in the winery. But they were largely gossip.\nThis was the first case that involved people who had a personal encounter, so Lu Sheng raised his ears and eavesdropped attentively on their conversation.\nIt was a good thing that they did not hush it up. They continued chatting loudly about the strange occurrences in the fishing villages.\n\"That water ghost… I saw it with my own eyes… it was over ten feet tall, with a green face and fangs, covered with lots of seaweed. Oh my goodness, if I, your big brother, didn’t run fast enough, you wouldn’t be able to see me now,\" the bald man was still having the shivers as he recalled it.\n\"Big brother, is the water ghost real?\" One of them was skeptical.\n\"Are you sure you didn’t make up this story?\" Another of them sneered.\nHaving heard to this point, Lu Sheng found it funny too. It was probably another boast by some boor from god-knows-where. He had seen many of his kind in this world.\nHaving eaten something and drunk some wine, he made a servant bring over the singing lady’s song list and casually looked it over.\nThree Meetings was not bad, but didn’t suit the atmosphere. He wanted to change it to a more joyous tune.\n\"PA!\"\nBut, right at that moment, the bald man slapped the table with his palm, his face now red.\n\"You really think that I, Boss Hu, only knows how to boast!? Look, look at what this is! That’s a piece of bone left behind by the water ghost! I secretly picked it up after the incident!\"\nHe retrieved a piece of jade-like green stone gingerly from his chest and slapped the tabletop with it.\n\"Isn’t that just a piece of mixed jade?\" One of them sneered.\n\"Mixed jade? This is mixed jade?! Go eat crap!\" The bald man’s face was red with rage.\n\"This brother over here. Can you show me that thing?\"\nA mild voice rang out from the side suddenly.\nLu Sheng was standing beside their table with a smile on his face. His gaze swept across the green piece of jade on the tabletop.\n\"This thing… you dare to take it? This was left behind by a water ghost,\" the bald man remarked in surprise.\nHe had merely taken it out to show it off for a while and was planning to throw it away a little later.\nAfter all, it was left behind by something inhuman. If it led the water ghost to him, he would really be in deep trouble.\n\"It’s ok. I just want to take a look,\" Lu Sheng did not believe in any tale about a water ghost. It just seemed to him that the piece of jade would sell well; it looked different from your average jade.\nThe average mixed jade could be purchased from shops and stalls everywhere. It was casually polished from jadeite corners and was extremely cheap.\nBut, for some strange reason, the moment he saw this piece of jade, he knew something was different about it.\nThe bald Boss Hu glanced at Lu Sheng and saw that he carried an extraordinary aura about him, dressed in clothes worn by the rich.\nHe wore a green robe and a white fox fur jacket. On his head was a jade officer hat, and on his feet, there were black-soled shoes with cloud patterns embroidered on them with silver threads.\nThe cost of his entire outfit was enough to pay for a few months’ worth of spending at The Osmanthus Winery... and probably enough to equal an average household’s annual expenditure as well.\n\"Well, Young Master, if you want it, er… just a talent of silver will do!\" The muscular man ventured after some hesitation.\n\"Deal,\" Lu Sheng let Little Qiao take out a talent of silver and place it on the table.\n\"It’s yours now,\" the bald man took the jade and stuffed it in Lu Sheng’s hands decisively. The few of them exchanged glances with each other, rose from the table and left.\nWithout another word, Lu Sheng watched them leave. He held up the jade in his hand for a closer examination.\n‘A talent of silver. If this was China on Earth, then we’re talking about a thousand Chinese dollars’ worth of purchasing power. Only in this life can I spend so extravagantly,’ he shook his head. A talent of silver meant nothing to him. According to the memories of his present body, his average monthly expenditure was at least above a hundred talents of silver. [2]\nOccasionally, he would even spend up to a thousand talents and more. That equaled millions on today’s Earth!\nThinking of this, he complained in his heart about what a prodigal the previous host of this body had been.\nIgnoring the stares of the surrounding onlookers, he held onto the jade, called Little Qiao and left the winery, heading towards the horse carriage waiting outside.\nYet right after stepping out of the winery, before he was even halfway there, he abruptly stood still and placed the jade in the heart of his palm.\nThere and then, in the middle of his right palm, the jade started melting!\nIn a matter of seconds, the originally hard rock dissolved into a pool of dark green goo. A faint but terrible scream came out from the goo.\n\"Poof!\"\nWithout warning, the goo exploded into a ball of green smoke and gradually dispersed in front of Lu Sheng.\nHe stood rooted to the ground in shock. Refocusing his sight, he saw that the jade was still in his palm, but the green sheen within it had vanished silently.\n‘Just now that was…’\nHe stood on the spot blankly, continuously recalling the image he had just seen.\n\"Young Master? Young Master???\" Little Qiao kept calling out beside him.\nLu Sheng snapped out of his reverie and looked at the jade in his hand once again. It was now nothing more than an ordinary cobblestone; not even a vestige of jade remained.\nHair stood on the back of his neck. Imperceptibly, he seemed to understand something.\n\"Let’s go. Back to the manor!\"\nLittle Qiao blinked and took a while to react. \"Okay…\"\nBoth of them boarded the carriage. The driver gave a few whips and two black hairy horses began to advance slowly.\nIn the carriage, Lu Sheng did not make a sound. He just kept staring at the cobblestone in his palm. At this point, Little Qiao too discovered the change in the stone.\n‘We got scammed again!’ She muttered in her heart but did not say much. ‘Young Master’s considered alright this time. The biggest scam he fell for in the past was that supposedly ancient wine flask. It cost over a thousand silver talents and almost drove Old Master to his grave. It’s just a talent of silver this time. Sometimes Young Master’s meal costs more than that.’\nThe horse carriage headed straight for the manor. As it passed by the city gates, Lu Sheng heard shouts from the outside.\n\"…I heard a while back that the water ghost has been exorcized! A travelling priest saved the fishing villages from danger!\"\n\"Has the court sent anyone?\"\n\"Yeah, already quite some time ago. I heard even the prefectural yamen’s Chief Constable Ouyang almost lost his life. Good thing he met a travelling priest. According to the news, when the priest attacked, there was a blinding golden flash and the water ghost cried out pathetically before turning into green goo. Afterward, it just exploded into thick smoke and then dispersed.\" [3]\n\"So it wasn’t attacked by the court’s experts?\"\n\"Of course not!\"\nLu Sheng could tell that it was the officers on guard duty chit-chatting.\nHe would often intentionally pass by the gates on this side of the city. The soldiers on guard duty were well-informed of the latest news and loved to brag and bullshit about strange news from all over the region.\n‘What a coincidence…’ Lu Sheng’s face betrayed nothing.\nRecalling that piece of jade from earlier, his heart sank.\nMeanwhile, the horse carriage lumbered on toward Ku Rong Street – the most prosperous part of the city.\n[1] ED/N: Before Lu Sheng was addressed \"young master\", whereas here the servant girl adds the character for \"big\", which has a more respectful sound to it. While I’m not a TL so I can’t tell for sure with my much worse Chinese, it seems to mean that he’s the oldest son of his parents (which is a fact) or the oldest youth in his generation in his family (branch families likely do not count). It could also mean that he’s the first in line to inherit the family head’s position. Later on, she’ll also use this form of address (but also at least one more word that also translates to \"young master\"). There are many ways to say \"young master\" in Chinese, but we’ll always translate them as \"young master\" (sometimes we’ll use capital letters to emphasize the instances where it’s a translation of a more respectful Chinese version).\n[2] ED/N: Chinese dollars = Yuan = Renminbi.

Of course, with regards to its authenticity, we remain unsure despite our examination. After all, stuff like inner force takes a long time to practice and evaluate. We can’t tell if it’s genuine or fake in the short term. But, from our examination of the book’s material, we can confirm that the fabric used has exceeded one hundred years in age!\"\nThe host chuckled twice as he saw that he had succeeded in rousing the audience. All lines of sight zoomed in on him.\nThen he continued slowly. \"This secret manual’s name is Black Fury Skill.\"\nLifting a yellow-bronze plate, the two dwarves slowly sauntered up the stage. On the plate, there was a pitch-black booklet made of silk cloth.\n\"This Black Fury Skill has thirty-two levels in total. According to the records in it, every rise in level will be accompanied with a tempering of one’s body. The manual here contains levels one to five.\"\n\"Tsk, turns out it’s incomplete,\" someone among the audience immediately voiced their dissatisfaction.\n\"Inner Qi is already tough enough to train in to begin with... it’s so iffy and nebulous. And now, your secret manual isn’t even complete? Who would dare to use it? If somebody had modified any parts of it, to practice it would mean to court death!\" Another mocked.\n\"Well, you don’t have to buy it,\" yet another scorned.\n\"Everyone, please be silent,\" the host said with a smile, lowering both his arms. \"This Black Fury Skill manual was actually deposited with us for auction by a client. Actually, this client had also verified with us the authenticity of a portion of it. Let’s not talk about the rest. At least the first three levels can definitely be practiced.\"\nHe thought that those words would certainly impress and rouse the audience. However, nobody changed their attitude.\nLu Sheng shook his head slightly; he understood why this was so. Zheng Xiangui, however, was puzzled.\n\"Brother Sheng, what happened? There’s something wrong with this response, isn’t there?\"\n\"Nothing’s wrong, this is very normal,\" Lu Sheng replied flatly. \"Inner force manuals take years to practice… It’s really too long. Regardless of whether or not there’s somebody to demonstrate it, no one dares to put his or her stakes on it.\"\n\"Moreover, I’ve heard Uncle Zhao mention that inner force isn’t as powerful as the legends have it. Unless one practices it to the pinnacle level, its force sometimes even loses to that of a strike by an outer force expert at full strength.\"\n\"Why’s that so?\" Zheng Xiangui was even more puzzled now.\n\"Perhaps Young Master isn’t well acquainted with this area,\" spoke a captain of the guard standing behind them at that moment.\nHis name was Chen Dewu, one of the Zheng family’s guard’s two strongest captains. This trip to the Black Meeting was too important, so he was sent here to maintain order.\nLike Uncle Zhao, he was also one of the few outer force martial arts masters of the Strength Proficiency level venerated in the city.\nChen Dewu glanced at Lu Sheng, then continued, \"Be it inner force or outer force, they’re all training in strength. The route of outer force training emphasizes increasing one’s physical muscular strength by training with external strikes and forcibly stimulating one’s own body. Such a method surely takes its toll on the body, but increases strength very rapidly.\nThe route of inner force training focuses on cultivating and tempering the internal organs and nourishing Qi and blood. Although this method takes much longer as it raises one’s strength at a slower pace, it doesn’t damage the body and can increase one’s lifespan.\nThat’s the difference between inner and outer force. Actually, pinnacle outer force experts can hold their own against inner force cultivators. The really powerful ones are those who practice both inner force and outer force...\"\n\"I see…\" Zheng Xiangui remarked in realization.\nLu Sheng nodded as well. \"I’ve heard Uncle Zhao say the same before as well.\"\n\"Then why’s everyone still so mad about inner force training? Both are on par in terms of raising one’s strength anyway,\" Zheng Xiangui raised a doubt.\n\"For longevity, of course… strong as they may be, outer force experts are past their prime the moment they’re past thirty. But once you have inner force, you can extend your prime into your fifties or even sixties. The two are entirely incomparable,\" Chen Dewu replied with longing.\nPresently, Lu Sheng’s attention was focused on the secret manual on the stage, for which the bidding was about to start.\nThe host pointed at the black cloth manual in the tray.\n\"Bidding begins now. The starting price is a hundred talents!\"\n\"A hundred and thirty talents.\"\n\"A hundred and fifty!\"\n\"Two hundred!\"\n\"Three hundred!\"\n\"Three hundred thirty talents!\"\nOne by one, the bidders increased the price. Even some of those who’d made sarcastic comments earlier were participating.\nThat went to show that while everyone had reservations about the manual, they were still rather confident in the Black Meeting’s reputation and examination standards.\n\"Somebody’s purposely jacking up the price,\" Fatso mumbled.\nLu Sheng’s narrowed eyes were staring at the stage.\n\"Five hundred talents!\" He raised his arm and shouted.\nThe entire meeting fell into silence momentarily at the sudden increment of a hundred talents.\nIn this age, the purchasing power of five hundred talents was equivalent to five hundred thousand Chinese dollars.\nAll for a manual whose authenticity wasn’t proven and might contain mistakes or omissions.\n\"Five hundred and fifty talents,\" a voice rang out again.\nLu Sheng looked over. It was a yellow-skinned man with drooping eyes.\nHis masked face also appeared dry and skinny, as if without much meat or skin. His eyes, however, looked savage. One look revealed that he was no kind-hearted soul.\nLu Sheng had expected such a situation. How could something like an inner force secret manual not be fought over?\nNot taking it to heart, he continued raising his arm.\n\"Six hundred talents.\"\n\"Seven hundred talents!\"\nIt was him again. Lu Sheng had only just raised a bid and he immediately followed.\n\"Eight hundred talents!\" Lu Sheng said calmly. His dad Lu Quanan had given him two thousand talents for his monthly allowance. Even if it cost him all of it, he would use them all to win this manual.\nAnyway, with the Modifier, all it took was some possibility of being initiated in a martial art for him to find its name on the Modifier and modify it directly to its extreme.\n\"Nine hundred talents!\"\nThat man’s savage eyes glared towards Lu Sheng.\n\"A thousand talents,\" Lu Sheng said composedly.\n\"… One thousand and one hundred talents!\" The other party’s voice now sounded slightly forced. \"Friend, I’m of the Zhang family of the White Jade. Give me some face.\"\n‘Zhang family of the White Jade?’ Lu Sheng’s face twitched.\nThis Zhang family wasn’t from the Nine Links City; rather, it was the top family in the nearby Zi Hua City – the family of the Zi Hua Prefect Zhang Song.\n\"Oh, the Zhang family of the White Jade. To think that they’d come over to our Nine Links City to hunt for stuff…\" Beside him, Zheng Xiangui’s voice was overflowing with surprise.\nHis Zheng family was in charge of the Black Meeting and was concerned only with the auction. They didn’t care about where the guests had come from.\n\"One thousand two hundred talents!\"\nLu Sheng raised his arm again.\nAnger smoldered in the eyes of the man from Zhang family. In the region near Nine Links and Zi Hua City, he had never encountered anyone who stepped on the Zhang family’s face like this thus far.\nThe Zhang family did not merely possess the Prefect Zhang Song. They were also proud to have within their ranks the number one expert of Zi Hua City – Zhang Songxi.\nThey had spread their influence in both the government and the underside of the society – that was their greatest assurance when they did as they pleased outside.\n\"Just ignore him. Items auctioned at a Black Meeting go to the person with the highest bid. Even the Zhang family doesn’t dare to break this rule lightly. Or else who would still work with them in their jade business?\" Zheng Xiangui gloated in his misfortune.\nThe man from Zhang family was named Zhang Jundong – a specialist who had come to Nine Links City to gather any and all secret inner force manuals that may appear.\nActually, the Zhang family had eyes on every secret inner force manual on the market and would intercept them before they were retrieved and placed on auction.\nOnly this one fell through a gap in their net in Nine Links City as it was deposited at a Black Meeting for auction by a client who had arrived abruptly. Since it didn’t go through the regular route, it escaped their interception.\n\"One thousand three hundred talents!\" Zhang Jundong gritted his teeth and raised his arm again.\n\"One thousand four hundred!\" Lu Sheng refused to yield in the slightest.\nPresently, only the two of them were competing against each other; none of the rest intended to take part in it.\n\"One thousand five hundred talents!\" Zhang Jundong glared at Lu Sheng unflinchingly. \"Friend, when you’re out on the roads, it’s better to have more friends. Let me have this manual today and the Zhang family will remember this favor.\"\nLu Sheng’s face did not change.\n\"One thousand six hundred talents.\"\nHe raised his arm and bid again.\nZhang Jundong was thoroughly incensed. He had come primarily for this Black Fury Skill, expecting to acquire it within an estimate of a thousand talents and pocketing the rest of the fund. Little did he expect that an ill-mannered weirdo would jump out of nowhere and compete with him so stubbornly.\n\"One thousand, seven hundred and fifty talents!\" He rose to his feet without warning, placing all of his money onto his bid at one go.\n\"One thousand eight hundred!\"\nLu Sheng’s face was impassive.\nZhang Jundong turned his head and glared at Lu Sheng with murderous intent.\n\"Well done! Very good,\" he declined to say a word more and gauged Lu Sheng from top to toe with his eyes instead, as if trying to commit every detail about him to his memory.\nWith a wave of his arm, Zhang Jundong rose in anger and stormed out.\n\"Congratulations to this mister,\" the host smiled from ear to ear. For an inner force manual whose authenticity and accuracy was uncertain to fetch such a high price... he was bound to earn a commission several times higher than usual.\nReceiving the secret manual, Lu Sheng handed over the silver notes.\nThen, he left on his own after telling Zheng Xiangui that he’s going to leave first. He didn’t even stay to look at the last item on auction.\nHe got his goods and was out of money.\nChen Wude followed him all the way out and even brought along two guards, fearing Lu Sheng may suffer a mishap.\nFollowing the route from which he had come, he left the karst cave. Lu Sheng looked at the skies outside; it was already deep into the night.\nThe Zheng family’s horse carriage was already waiting outside.\nChen Wude could not go far and so let a few guards leave with Lu Sheng. He himself returned to stay by Young Master Zheng Xiangui’s side.\nBringing three guards along with him, Lu Sheng exited the stone house and was about to board the carriage.\n\"Hoo...\"\nAll of a sudden, a gust of wind blew over from the surroundings of the village.\nA guard went on the alert and surveyed the surroundings but found nothing wrong.\n\"TCH!\"\nWith the soft sound of friction, a black shadow flew past a guard without warning, penetrating the small circle of guards and rushing straight for Lu Sheng who was right at its center.\nThe black shadow moved extremely fast. The guards’ formation was completely bypassed before they could even react.\n\"DANG, DANG, DANG!\"\nThree sharp clangs rang out. A short blade in the black shadow’s hand had swiftly left cuts on the arms of the three guards.\nThe three grunted in pain and quickly retreated, clutching their wrists.\nThey were merely mercenaries employed by the Zheng family as guards, not die-hard loyalists. Naturally, they weren’t going to put their lives on the line for the Zheng family.\nSeeing that the black shadow could not be stopped, they might as well focus on their own safety. After all, they already had wounds on their wrists to show for their efforts.\nHarboring such thoughts, their formation of three instantly broke apart, completely exposing Lu Sheng within it.\n\"Die!\" A deep, raspy voice came out of the black figure’s mouth.\nHe lifted his short blade and slashed towards Lu Sheng’s chest violently.\nDespite his speed and strength decreasing considerably after wounding the three men, it was still a piece of cake for him to deal with an ordinary rich young master.\nMoreover, even if the other party was a martial arts practitioner, it wouldn’t make a difference. Apart from a few in Nine Links City that could be counted on one hand, none of the fighters in this region were his match.\nBefore striking, Zhang Jundong had carefully observed that the other party was not among their ranks.\nWhile he introduced himself a member of the Zhang family at the auction, he simultaneously harbored another identity.\nHe was none other but one of the notorious bandit chiefs outside Zi Hua City!\nSince he was outbid at the auction and failed to secure the manual, then he might as well take it by force. It wouldn’t be his first time doing so after all. And, no one at the Black Meeting would guarantee the safety of its bidders anyway.\nAfter killing the other party and securing the manual, he could even save over a thousand talents out of nothing for his own expenditure. So, why not?"}]}
