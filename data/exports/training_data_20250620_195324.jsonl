Of course, with regards to its authenticity, we remain unsure despite our examination. After all, stuff like inner force takes a long time to practice and evaluate. We can’t tell if it’s genuine or fake in the short term. But, from our examination of the book’s material, we can confirm that the fabric used has exceeded one hundred years in age!\"\nThe host chuckled twice as he saw that he had succeeded in rousing the audience. All lines of sight zoomed in on him.\nThen he continued slowly. \"This secret manual’s name is Black Fury Skill.\"\nLifting a yellow-bronze plate, the two dwarves slowly sauntered up the stage. On the plate, there was a pitch-black booklet made of silk cloth.\n\"This Black Fury Skill has thirty-two levels in total. According to the records in it, every rise in level will be accompanied with a tempering of one’s body. The manual here contains levels one to five.\"\n\"Tsk, turns out it’s incomplete,\" someone among the audience immediately voiced their dissatisfaction.\n\"Inner Qi is already tough enough to train in to begin with... it’s so iffy and nebulous. And now, your secret manual isn’t even complete? Who would dare to use it? If somebody had modified any parts of it, to practice it would mean to court death!\" Another mocked.\n\"Well, you don’t have to buy it,\" yet another scorned.\n\"Everyone, please be silent,\" the host said with a smile, lowering both his arms. \"This Black Fury Skill manual was actually deposited with us for auction by a client. Actually, this client had also verified with us the authenticity of a portion of it. Let’s not talk about the rest. At least the first three levels can definitely be practiced.\"\nHe thought that those words would certainly impress and rouse the audience. However, nobody changed their attitude.\nLu Sheng shook his head slightly; he understood why this was so. Zheng Xiangui, however, was puzzled.\n\"Brother Sheng, what happened? There’s something wrong with this response, isn’t there?\"\n\"Nothing’s wrong, this is very normal,\" Lu Sheng replied flatly. \"Inner force manuals take years to practice… It’s really too long. Regardless of whether or not there’s somebody to demonstrate it, no one dares to put his or her stakes on it.\"\n\"Moreover, I’ve heard Uncle Zhao mention that inner force isn’t as powerful as the legends have it. Unless one practices it to the pinnacle level, its force sometimes even loses to that of a strike by an outer force expert at full strength.\"\n\"Why’s that so?\" Zheng Xiangui was even more puzzled now.\n\"Perhaps Young Master isn’t well acquainted with this area,\" spoke a captain of the guard standing behind them at that moment.\nHis name was Chen Dewu, one of the Zheng family’s guard’s two strongest captains. This trip to the Black Meeting was too important, so he was sent here to maintain order.\nLike Uncle Zhao, he was also one of the few outer force martial arts masters of the Strength Proficiency level venerated in the city.\nChen Dewu glanced at Lu Sheng, then continued, \"Be it inner force or outer force, they’re all training in strength. The route of outer force training emphasizes increasing one’s physical muscular strength by training with external strikes and forcibly stimulating one’s own body. Such a method surely takes its toll on the body, but increases strength very rapidly.\nThe route of inner force training focuses on cultivating and tempering the internal organs and nourishing Qi and blood. Although this method takes much longer as it raises one’s strength at a slower pace, it doesn’t damage the body and can increase one’s lifespan.\nThat’s the difference between inner and outer force. Actually, pinnacle outer force experts can hold their own against inner force cultivators. The really powerful ones are those who practice both inner force and outer force...\"\n\"I see…\" Zheng Xiangui remarked in realization.\nLu Sheng nodded as well. \"I’ve heard Uncle Zhao say the same before as well.\"\n\"Then why’s everyone still so mad about inner force training? Both are on par in terms of raising one’s strength anyway,\" Zheng Xiangui raised a doubt.\n\"For longevity, of course… strong as they may be, outer force experts are past their prime the moment they’re past thirty. But once you have inner force, you can extend your prime into your fifties or even sixties. The two are entirely incomparable,\" Chen Dewu replied with longing.\nPresently, Lu Sheng’s attention was focused on the secret manual on the stage, for which the bidding was about to start.\nThe host pointed at the black cloth manual in the tray.\n\"Bidding begins now. The starting price is a hundred talents!\"\n\"A hundred and thirty talents.\"\n\"A hundred and fifty!\"\n\"Two hundred!\"\n\"Three hundred!\"\n\"Three hundred thirty talents!\"\nOne by one, the bidders increased the price. Even some of those who’d made sarcastic comments earlier were participating.\nThat went to show that while everyone had reservations about the manual, they were still rather confident in the Black Meeting’s reputation and examination standards.\n\"Somebody’s purposely jacking up the price,\" Fatso mumbled.\nLu Sheng’s narrowed eyes were staring at the stage.\n\"Five hundred talents!\" He raised his arm and shouted.\nThe entire meeting fell into silence momentarily at the sudden increment of a hundred talents.\nIn this age, the purchasing power of five hundred talents was equivalent to five hundred thousand Chinese dollars.\nAll for a manual whose authenticity wasn’t proven and might contain mistakes or omissions.\n\"Five hundred and fifty talents,\" a voice rang out again.\nLu Sheng looked over. It was a yellow-skinned man with drooping eyes.\nHis masked face also appeared dry and skinny, as if without much meat or skin. His eyes, however, looked savage. One look revealed that he was no kind-hearted soul.\nLu Sheng had expected such a situation. How could something like an inner force secret manual not be fought over?\nNot taking it to heart, he continued raising his arm.\n\"Six hundred talents.\"\n\"Seven hundred talents!\"\nIt was him again. Lu Sheng had only just raised a bid and he immediately followed.\n\"Eight hundred talents!\" Lu Sheng said calmly. His dad Lu Quanan had given him two thousand talents for his monthly allowance. Even if it cost him all of it, he would use them all to win this manual.\nAnyway, with the Modifier, all it took was some possibility of being initiated in a martial art for him to find its name on the Modifier and modify it directly to its extreme.\n\"Nine hundred talents!\"\nThat man’s savage eyes glared towards Lu Sheng.\n\"A thousand talents,\" Lu Sheng said composedly.\n\"… One thousand and one hundred talents!\" The other party’s voice now sounded slightly forced. \"Friend, I’m of the Zhang family of the White Jade. Give me some face.\"\n‘Zhang family of the White Jade?’ Lu Sheng’s face twitched.\nThis Zhang family wasn’t from the Nine Links City; rather, it was the top family in the nearby Zi Hua City – the family of the Zi Hua Prefect Zhang Song.\n\"Oh, the Zhang family of the White Jade. To think that they’d come over to our Nine Links City to hunt for stuff…\" Beside him, Zheng Xiangui’s voice was overflowing with surprise.\nHis Zheng family was in charge of the Black Meeting and was concerned only with the auction. They didn’t care about where the guests had come from.\n\"One thousand two hundred talents!\"\nLu Sheng raised his arm again.\nAnger smoldered in the eyes of the man from Zhang family. In the region near Nine Links and Zi Hua City, he had never encountered anyone who stepped on the Zhang family’s face like this thus far.\nThe Zhang family did not merely possess the Prefect Zhang Song. They were also proud to have within their ranks the number one expert of Zi Hua City – Zhang Songxi.\nThey had spread their influence in both the government and the underside of the society – that was their greatest assurance when they did as they pleased outside.\n\"Just ignore him. Items auctioned at a Black Meeting go to the person with the highest bid. Even the Zhang family doesn’t dare to break this rule lightly. Or else who would still work with them in their jade business?\" Zheng Xiangui gloated in his misfortune.\nThe man from Zhang family was named Zhang Jundong – a specialist who had come to Nine Links City to gather any and all secret inner force manuals that may appear.\nActually, the Zhang family had eyes on every secret inner force manual on the market and would intercept them before they were retrieved and placed on auction.\nOnly this one fell through a gap in their net in Nine Links City as it was deposited at a Black Meeting for auction by a client who had arrived abruptly. Since it didn’t go through the regular route, it escaped their interception.\n\"One thousand three hundred talents!\" Zhang Jundong gritted his teeth and raised his arm again.\n\"One thousand four hundred!\" Lu Sheng refused to yield in the slightest.\nPresently, only the two of them were competing against each other; none of the rest intended to take part in it.\n\"One thousand five hundred talents!\" Zhang Jundong glared at Lu Sheng unflinchingly. \"Friend, when you’re out on the roads, it’s better to have more friends. Let me have this manual today and the Zhang family will remember this favor.\"\nLu Sheng’s face did not change.\n\"One thousand six hundred talents.\"\nHe raised his arm and bid again.\nZhang Jundong was thoroughly incensed. He had come primarily for this Black Fury Skill, expecting to acquire it within an estimate of a thousand talents and pocketing the rest of the fund. Little did he expect that an ill-mannered weirdo would jump out of nowhere and compete with him so stubbornly.\n\"One thousand, seven hundred and fifty talents!\" He rose to his feet without warning, placing all of his money onto his bid at one go.\n\"One thousand eight hundred!\"\nLu Sheng’s face was impassive.\nZhang Jundong turned his head and glared at Lu Sheng with murderous intent.\n\"Well done! Very good,\" he declined to say a word more and gauged Lu Sheng from top to toe with his eyes instead, as if trying to commit every detail about him to his memory.\nWith a wave of his arm, Zhang Jundong rose in anger and stormed out.\n\"Congratulations to this mister,\" the host smiled from ear to ear. For an inner force manual whose authenticity and accuracy was uncertain to fetch such a high price... he was bound to earn a commission several times higher than usual.\nReceiving the secret manual, Lu Sheng handed over the silver notes.\nThen, he left on his own after telling Zheng Xiangui that he’s going to leave first. He didn’t even stay to look at the last item on auction.\nHe got his goods and was out of money.\nChen Wude followed him all the way out and even brought along two guards, fearing Lu Sheng may suffer a mishap.\nFollowing the route from which he had come, he left the karst cave. Lu Sheng looked at the skies outside; it was already deep into the night.\nThe Zheng family’s horse carriage was already waiting outside.\nChen Wude could not go far and so let a few guards leave with Lu Sheng. He himself returned to stay by Young Master Zheng Xiangui’s side.\nBringing three guards along with him, Lu Sheng exited the stone house and was about to board the carriage.\n\"Hoo...\"\nAll of a sudden, a gust of wind blew over from the surroundings of the village.\nA guard went on the alert and surveyed the surroundings but found nothing wrong.\n\"TCH!\"\nWith the soft sound of friction, a black shadow flew past a guard without warning, penetrating the small circle of guards and rushing straight for Lu Sheng who was right at its center.\nThe black shadow moved extremely fast. The guards’ formation was completely bypassed before they could even react.\n\"DANG, DANG, DANG!\"\nThree sharp clangs rang out. A short blade in the black shadow’s hand had swiftly left cuts on the arms of the three guards.\nThe three grunted in pain and quickly retreated, clutching their wrists.\nThey were merely mercenaries employed by the Zheng family as guards, not die-hard loyalists. Naturally, they weren’t going to put their lives on the line for the Zheng family.\nSeeing that the black shadow could not be stopped, they might as well focus on their own safety. After all, they already had wounds on their wrists to show for their efforts.\nHarboring such thoughts, their formation of three instantly broke apart, completely exposing Lu Sheng within it.\n\"Die!\" A deep, raspy voice came out of the black figure’s mouth.\nHe lifted his short blade and slashed towards Lu Sheng’s chest violently.\nDespite his speed and strength decreasing considerably after wounding the three men, it was still a piece of cake for him to deal with an ordinary rich young master.\nMoreover, even if the other party was a martial arts practitioner, it wouldn’t make a difference. Apart from a few in Nine Links City that could be counted on one hand, none of the fighters in this region were his match.\nBefore striking, Zhang Jundong had carefully observed that the other party was not among their ranks.\nWhile he introduced himself a member of the Zhang family at the auction, he simultaneously harbored another identity.\nHe was none other but one of the notorious bandit chiefs outside Zi Hua City!\nSince he was outbid at the auction and failed to secure the manual, then he might as well take it by force. It wouldn’t be his first time doing so after all. And, no one at the Black Meeting would guarantee the safety of its bidders anyway.\nAfter killing the other party and securing the manual, he could even save over a thousand talents out of nothing for his own expenditure.

In comparison, this child Lu Sheng’s actions indeed showed much more ambition than the others’ actions. As the chiding words appeared at the tip of his tongue, they turned into a sigh instead.\n\"If you want to practice martial arts, then you’d better find your Uncle Zhao and learn from him rather than practice blindly by yourself; it can easily lead to mishaps,\" he shook his head and turned to walk out of the door. Halfway there, he paused and added,\n\"If you need any medicine from the pharmacy, just go ahead. I’ll give you two thousand talents each month for your monthly allowance…\" He left in big strides after he had finished speaking.\nSecond mother Liu Cuiyu reached out and lightly wiped Lu Sheng’s perspiration off with a towel.\n\"Your father’s quite soft-hearted,\" she gave a long sigh.\n\"The Xu family’s Old Master and he were sworn brothers… Now that this has happened, he’s feeling very miserable. It’s good for you to practice martial arts. It’s just that, most who do so begin from a young age to establish a solid foundation. At this age now, it is rather late…\"\nShe prattled on and on about other things, but Lu Sheng was entirely unable to hear what she said.\nHis attention was wholly focused on the Black Tiger Saber Technique that he had newly acquired.\n‘It’s really incredible…’\nLu Sheng narrowed his eyes a little. On the surface, it seemed like he was listening to his second mother, but in reality he was assessing the state of his body.\nHe flexed his biceps.\n‘The muscles on my arms are the same as they were. Yet, there’s this feeling of familiarity, a strong sense of muscle memory as if I’ve undergone many years’ practice. It’s simply…’\nHe again tried to flex his muscles, this time on his legs.\nClearly, the muscles on his legs could exert strength much more easily than previously.\nHe could distinctly feel his strength from both his legs quickly coursing upwards, all the way to his waist and then to both his arms.\nThis fluidity in the flow of strength was described in great detail in the Black Tiger saber Technique.\nThis was called Strength Proficiency.\n‘If it is as the saber Technique says, most people who practice martial arts would have a method to circulate a huge amount of the body’s strength. One is already considered an expert if he is able to mobilize 50% of his total physical strength. To be able to mobilize 80% of one’s strength means to enter the so-called Strength Proficiency realm.’\nLu Sheng considered those things in his mind while taking into account the memories originally present in his current body as well as what he had once heard from Uncle Zhao and in conversations with other martial experts regarding the matter.\nThe Strength Proficiency realm was reckoned to be more or less one of the very highest levels achieved by those within Nine Links City.\nEven for a normal person, to be able to consolidate their strength and focus it into one strike would result in a terrifying speed and strength far surpassing the limits of an ordinary person.\n‘Uncle Zhao is exactly in that Strength Proficiency realm…’ Lu Sheng sighed inwardly. The effects of the Modifier were not compromised in the slightest. This thoroughly removed the worry weighing down on his heart.\n\"It’s a pity that the Modifier seems to expend a combination of one’s mental energy, Qi and the sort. Just modifying an ordinary saber technique once has actually almost caused me to lose both qi and blood to the point of being bedridden… and it’s not even one of those legendary inner force or Qi skills.\"\nLu Sheng was gradually coming to understand the essential nature of the Modifier.\nIt was basically just like an adjustment device that was able to imprint one’s body with experience, memories, instincts and martial arts.\nHowever, this sort of adjustment required energy consumption, which apparently occurred at the expense of his mental energy and Qi.\nMoreover, there was no guarantee of instant success when adjusting one’s body and mind.\n‘The body is like a pile of materials. The Modifier seems to make use of these materials, and establishes a new foundation upon the original base. But it cannot just increase the muscle strength or bone strength from nothing.’ Lu Sheng obtained hypothesized.\nIn the following few days, the changes to his body also confirmed his hypothesis.\nIt began to slowly recover since Day One. At the same time, sturdy muscles gradually formed on his arms, legs, chest and back.\nMoreover, Lu Sheng felt an obvious change as the pain in his body turned to numbness. On his palms, a thick horny layer steadily appeared. [1]\nHis appetite also grew larger and larger.\nIn order to hide these sudden changes, he would sneak out by himself each day to have extra meals outside.\nFour meals within the house: three basic meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) plus a midnight snack.\nOutside, he would still eat the same portions as he did at home.\nThis carried on for seven days. After that, Lu Sheng’s whole body became slightly sturdier, and his stature was no longer as thin and weak as it used to be in the past.\nAs for the saber technique manual, he had long since returned it intact to Uncle Zhao.\nHaving heard how he was ill and bedridden, Uncle Zhao didn’t say anything much. When he received the manual, he merely shook his head and sighed without raising the matter of the saber practice.\nLu Sheng guessed that Uncle Zhao probably thought that he had recklessly tried to practice and hurt himself as a result.\nIndeed, Uncle Zhao’s thoughts were just like that.\nInitially, he had wanted to wait till Lu Sheng faced difficulties in saber practice before helping him clarify his doubts and clear up any confusion. Who knew that, in the blink of an eye, he would hear that Young Master Lu Sheng would be bedridden from injuries. And then, he had even come to return the secret manual, without mentioning the matter of the Black Tiger Saber Technique again.\nThus, he concluded that Lu Sheng was no longer interested and had given up.\nRegarding this, Uncle Zhao could only sigh and say nothing.\nEverything returned to as it had been in the past days.\nThe Xu family’s demise seemingly did not have a big influence on life in the Lu Manor.\nThe younger generation continued with their hikes, drank their flower wine, listened to tunes, went horse riding, attended poetry shows and flower exhibitions. Although Nine Links City was not huge, it was not small either; there were plenty of these entertainment establishments.\nAs for the older generation, they occasionally attended this and that gathering and went to the city to participate in yamen’s meetings.\nLu Quanan also buried his head in devoting all of his energy to business dealings.\nIt seemed that everyone had already forgotten about the Xu Family’s tragedy. They once again lived the same lives as before.\nThat is, with the exception of two people.\nOne of them was Lu Yiyi. Having lost her fiancé, her sweetheart, her face was continually bathed in tears. She looked more and more haggard.\nThe other was Lu Sheng. He now liked to venture out a lot more.\nHe didn't go to enjoy himself by listening to music and dancing, but rather went outside the city to find a clear patch in the small forest nearby.\nThere, he minded his own business and started to attempt practicing the Black Tiger Saber Technique.\n***\nBlack winds blew among the mountain ridges located along the southwest region of Nine Links City.\nThe sound of wind whistled in the dark night.\nLu Sheng was hurrying in their direction, carrying a long-hilted saber he had bought at a blacksmith’s shop.\nHe did not intend to reach Black Winds Ridge; he merely wanted to find an opportunity to test his saber skills.\nHe had obtained the Black Tiger Saber Technique through the Modifier, which he did not intend to divulge. This would be his ultimate trump card.\nTo outsiders, everyone believed him to be an ordinary young master of a wealthy family, too weak to even truss a chicken.\nUsing their prejudice, he could rely on this skill of his to turn the tables on his opponent should he find himself in a dangerous situation.\nOf course, all this was dependent on the actual usefulness of the Black Tiger Saber Technique in combat.\nLu Sheng wasn't sure where Black Winds Ridge exactly was, or how far it was from Nine Links City.\nThere was no night curfew in Nine Links City; its city gates were open even at night. He changed into a simple and plain clothing and then used ladies’ cosmetic powder to slightly alter his appearance. Alone, he dressed in thick clothes and lowered his head to cover his face.\nAnd so, he became just a random tourist whom nobody knew.\nBorrowing the dark of the night, Lu Sheng left the city, his eyes gazing into the distance.\nThe pitch-black wilderness of the mountains seemed like a huge, hibernating beast, concealed in the silence under the moon.\nHis heart was beating quickly.\nHowever, he had to hide himself if he wanted to test out the true power of the Black Tiger Saber Technique.\nStanding in front of the city gate, he plucked up his courage and walked in the direction of Black Winds Ridge.\n\"Ding, Ding, Ding…\"\nA caravan returning in the night was just entering the city from the main road.\nThe wind chimes that hung on the carriages rang out as they swung about in the wind, their sound carrying far into the distance of the night.\nLu Sheng exited the city from the side doors.\nThe city gates of Nine Links City were very strange. Not only were they kept open through the night, there was quite a number of them as well. The walls seemed tall and sturdy, but the truth was that there were many cracks in the walls, air seeping through them. It was hardly useful for defense at all.\n\"Returning late at night again today?\"\n\"Precisely… it’s pitch-dark at night, and the carriage wheels were twisted while rushing back. What bad luck!\"\nThe leader of the caravan and the city guards talked on the main road at the central city gates; the sound of their conversation floated over.\nLu Sheng stood on a small road facing southwest. In comparison to the main road, this one was a lot narrower.\nOnly two torches on the city walls lit the black side doors. Dim light emanated from them, lighting up a mere half a meter or so of the way ahead.\n\"This is indeed the ancient times…\" Lu Sheng heaved a sigh in his heart.\nLooking out, it was pitch-black in all of the three directions ahead. Only Nine Links City at the back offered some light.\n\"No flashlights or street lights. The wilderness of the ancient times is simply a paradise for the wild predators.\"\nHe hesitated for a slight moment, but experience from the Black Tiger Saber Technique that surged through his body caused his fear to diminish.\nThis was because the Black Tiger Saber Mantra provided a method to deal with such a pitch-black environment.\nOr rather, the Black Tiger itself was an excellent hunter that could see well in pitch-darkness. The Black Tiger Saber Technique demanded one to be sensitive to the sounds of the wind to determine one’s surroundings, and thus its users did not fear such an environment.\nTightening his belt, Lu Sheng grasped the long-hilted saber tightly, walking onto the narrow road towards Black Winds Ridges with haste.\nAbout a hundred meters along the narrow road, he withdrew two flints from his waist pouch, and lowered a small torch from his back that he had prepared earlier.\nWith a flint at the head of the torch, he exerted all his might to rub another against it.\n\"POP!\"\nSparks sputtered out from the head of the torch.\nThe red sparks appeared in a small number, but then spread to the whole head of the torch.\nThere was finally some light in the pitch-darkness.\nLu Sheng turned and gazed backwards. The lights from Nine Links City were already very faint.\nHe lifted the torch and proceeded forward slowly.\n‘According to what the hunter said, a wild wolf often roams this stretch of road at night. Well, we’ll see how good my luck is.’\nHe did not dare to really go to Black Winds Ridge. Having learnt that there was a high likelihood that things like ghosts and monsters existed in this world, he naturally did not dare to venture too far away from the city.\nIf it weren’t for the fact that he was still unable to test out the true ability of his skills even after devising various methods while inside the city, he would not have come out here alone to try his luck.\nAfter continuing onwards for another stretch of distance, he soon noticed tracks on the ground.\nJust as the old hunter had said, these were the tracks of a wild wolf.\nThere were also a few pieces of white, clayish egg-shaped feces.\nLu Sheng picked up a stone to poke the feces. It was already dried and hardened by the wind. As it broke apart from the poking, something like fingernail parts was revealed from the inside.\n‘It should be this place… This lump of feces should be from a few days ago. According to the words of the old hunter, he just saw that old wolf here yesterday. It should be somewhere around here.’\nLu Sheng held the torch in one hand, while the other unhurriedly drew the long-hilted saber from behind his waist.\nThe long-hilted saber was a type of a saber derived from a combination of a weapon and a farming tool. It had a very long hilt.\nThe hilt and the blade of Lu Sheng’s saber were roughly of the same length. When the blade was removed, it could be used as a pole for farming. It was somewhat similar to a small glaive.\nIt took him quite some strength to wield it with one hand. He might as well stick the torch into the crack of a stone that lay at the side.\nHe was surrounded by messy heaps of stones in weird shapes and sizes. There weren’t any trees around, and thus there was no fear of anything catching fire.\nLu Sheng stuck the torch in between the rocks and carefully retrieved a paper bag from his waist pouch. Inside it, there was a slab of fresh pork he had carved out earlier this afternoon.\nHe slowly unfolded the grease paper and lay it onto the ground.\nThere were still traces of blood on the surface of the meat slab. A raw smell of blood soon wafted in the wind, spreading around the area.\nLu Sheng lifted his saber and hid himself a short distance away, hunched behind a big rock, waiting.\nThe wind was rather cold.\nLu Sheng tilted his body, sticking to the white rock that was slightly taller than a person, and gazed in the direction of the meat slab.\nTime passed by slowly.\n\"Howl…\"\nSoon, the wind brought with it a faint sound, similar to the wind yet reminiscent of the whimpering of some animal.\n\"HOO!\"\nSuddenly, a black shadow flashed from the side. The light from the torch reflected in and revealed a pair of lush green eyes.\nThe black shadow moved with extreme speed. In a moment, it pounced on the meat slab, held the meat in its mouth, and sped away.\nLu Sheng rejoiced, and was about to move.\nSuddenly, his back tightened as a gust of cold wind blew against it.\nLu Sheng’s eyes went wide. Lifting the long-hilted saber, he turned around and swung it, delivering a horizontal slash.\n[1] ED/N: \"Horny\" as in hard and rough.

But…\"\nFatso was put on a spot. ‘What kind of people attend the Black Meeting? Murderers, robbers, burglars, thieves, people with shady backgrounds! If Brother Sheng accidentally got embroiled in a conflict and got hurt, that’d be really unfortunate.’\n\"But I better keep a low profile, right?\" Lu Sheng smiled. He understood his concern.\nHe was representing not merely himself, but also Nine Links City’s Lu family. Once any mishap happened to him, the Lu Manor would settle scores with Zheng Xiangui for sure.\n\"It’s best that you understand it. Brother Sheng, your identity isn’t like anyone else’s. If it were anyone else, I wouldn’t be so worried…\" Zheng Xiangui sighed.\n\"I got it. Just make the arrangements. I must lay my hands on that thing,\" Lu Sheng insisted.\n\"Sigh…\" Zheng Xiangui sighed helplessly as he complied.\nLu Sheng confirmed the starting time of the Black Meeting with him carefully. Then, he waited while Zheng Xiangui instructed someone to bring over a VIP invitation.\nWith the invitation in hand, he finally left the restaurant.\n\"High-grade cosmetic powder! Ladies, come and take a look!\"\n\"High quality first-grade products from the Central Plains, just imported from Zi Hua City!\"\n\"Blusher that’s exclusively from Purple Sun & Floral Scent. You can’t find it anywhere else!\"\nOn the streets outside the restaurant, hawkers pushed their wooden carts laden with cosmetic powders, inching along the sides of the streets.\nLu Sheng’s glance swept over them. The street in front of him specialized in selling cosmetic products. Many women and ladies loved to shop here.\nA light rain had just fallen on the street, leaving a wet layer on it. The rays of the setting sun reflected off them, dyeing the entire street into a faint red hue.\nLu Sheng breathed out. The moment his breath left his mouth, it condensed into white mist which dispersed gradually.\nHe turned back to look at the restaurant. The Goldfish Restaurant cast a giant shadow under the sun.\nThis was the largest restaurant in Nine Links City and it happened to be its peak hours. Customers streamed in and out of the restaurant incessantly, creating an unusual commotion and din.\nStanding in the shadow of the restaurant, Lu Sheng looked towards both its sides.\nOther places were rather neglected.\nHawkers inched along, pushing their carts with cosmetic goods, moving without stopping in the shade.\nAs Lu Sheng watched on, he thought of buying some gifts for second mother and Yiyi. These cosmetic powders weren’t expensive, and sometimes one could find quality goods that’d serve as fine gifts.\nHe strolled along the streets, trying to pick a good hawker.\nAs the afternoon went on, the streets grew increasingly deserted and many shops closed for the day.\nThe number of people on both sides of the street shrank to just a few. Lu Sheng met them only occasionally.\nThe strange thing was that these hawkers selling cosmetic goods could clearly see that there weren’t many people around them, and yet they still smiled and hawked their goods with great effort.\nHawking yells rose and fell here and there, reverberating across the big empty street.\nLu Sheng’s eyes narrowed, but didn’t think that anything was amiss. ‘Perhaps this is a custom or phenomenon unique to this world.’\nGlancing from left to right, he finally picked a hawker pushing a cart painted in light red. A pole was attached to the cart, and a flag on it that read: \"Central Plains’ Li’s Cosmetic Goods\".\nThe hawker moved along slowly, pushing his cart, with a big smile on his face. He was clad in a grey linen robe and a greyish white melon peel cap.\n‘I think Li’s Cosmetic Goods is quite an established business from the Central Plains.’\nLu Sheng recalled from his memory and slowly headed towards the hawker, intending to pick some quality cosmetic powder for second mother and Yiyi.\nThe hawker gradually moved forward. Near him, a few kids were having fun, chasing each other and playing.\nThe cart went past the children, then turned into a small alley in the shadows.\nLu Sheng guessed that the hawker was probably about to call it a day. So, he hastened his steps, going after him.\n\"Ai! Brother Sheng!\"\nSuddenly, a voice called from behind him. It was a pretty familiar voice, as if from someone he knew.\nLu Sheng turned around to see a tanned, muscular scholar walk towards him in big strides.\n\"Luo Sheng?\" [1]\nHe hesitated for a moment before recognizing him.\nLuo Sheng, aka Luo Junyi, was a classic rich young master in Nine Links City, just like Lu Sheng. But, unlike others, this lad possessed an actual academic degree; he had just passed the prefectural level exam recently and became a xiucai. News was that he had quite the literary flair. [2]\nActually, Luo Junyi had a very ordinary friendship with him. It just so happened that his name coincided with that of a Mount Liang hero, hence Lu Sheng remembered his name after hearing it once.\n\"Brother Sheng, it’s an emergency, an emergency!\" Loo Junyi took two steps towards him, red-faced.\nLu Sheng immediately understood why this dude came looking for him. Although he was a young master of a rich family, he extremely loved gambling and often gambled to his last penny, winding up borrowing money from all over the place.\nIt looked like he had depleted his gambling capital again.\nLu Sheng laughed as he took out ten talents of silver from his waist pouch and handed them over.\n\"How’s your luck today?\"\n\"Acceptable, acceptable, hahaha… I knew I could count on Brother Sheng,\" Luo Junyi took the silver and left hurriedly.\nLu Sheng shook his head. The money was a small matter. Lu family’s business and estate was enormous after all. Somebody would come handing over money just around the corner.\nHe turned to find the hawker selling cosmetic goods again.\nThe hawker’s cart had already entered the alley, leaving only a small half of it outside.\nWith great strides, he swiftly walked over and followed it into the alley.\n\"Eh??\"\nLu Sheng froze in his tracks. This was an alley with a dead end!\nThe alley was empty, without a hawker, a cart or any living soul to be found.\nHis eyes both narrowed to a slit and his body became poised and alert.\nFrom beginning to end, left to right, he carefully examined this blind alley.\nIt was an alley over ten meters long, formed by the greyish black walls of the houses on both sides. At its end, it was blocked by an aged black wall, with a few seals glued across it.\nThe seals of made of white paper and red letters looked dark under the sunset. Their corners flew up, having lost their adhesiveness.\n\"No trapdoors on the walls... where could the cart have gone…?\"\nLu Sheng kept searching his memory. He clearly remembered that the cart had entered this alley between the houses.\nHe backed out of it and saw the few children who were still playing and chasing one another. These kids wore simple clothes and seemed to come from ordinary families.\nLu Sheng plastered on a smiley face and fished out a few bronze coins from his pocket. He caught a little girl who was giving chase.\n\"Little girl, can I ask you something?\"\n\"What do you want to ask, brother? Please ask.\"\nThe little girl sported two ponytails and was nine or ten years-old, her cheeks red and puffy. Perhaps because she was used to playing on the streets, she was unafraid of strangers and replied straightforwardly.\n\"Brother would like to ask - did you see that Li’s Cosmetic Goods cart pass by here just now? Did it enter this alley here?\"\nLu Sheng stuffed two bronze coins into the little girl’s palms. A radiant smile immediately broke out on the little girl’s face.\n\"I didn’t see any cosmetic goods cart, did I? We play here every day. The cosmetic goods carts usually come only in the morning. In the afternoon, they all go over to the antique street.\"\n\"You didn’t see it?\" Lu Sheng was stunned. He felt that the kid was lying.\nBut then he saw the earnest expression on the little girl’s wide-eyed face.\n\"What I said is true. There really weren’t any carts on the streets today. If you don’t believe me, you can go ask others. There’s nothing at all on the streets,\" the rest of the children ran over and voiced their assent.\n\"Yea yea. My mum was even gonna come over to get some stuff, but not even one cart could be seen. It’s really strange.\"\n\"This brother says he just saw a Li’s Cosmetic Goods,\" the little girl pointed at Lu Sheng.\n\"Where? Where?\"\n\"I don’t see it. That’s all that there is to this street.\"\n\"Brother probably saw it in his dreams? Heeheehee…\"\nThe group of lads broke out in laughter and din again.\nThe smile on Lu Sheng’s face gradually vanished. He turned his head to look at the Goldfish Restaurant.\nThe restaurant under the shadow was crowded with business. Its extraordinary liveliness of was in stark contrast to the desertedness of the streets here.\n\"In that case, did you all see…\"\nLu Sheng turned back and his voice froze.\nThe kids around him had all disappeared god-knows-when. All around him, the street was deserted, empty and devoid of anything.\nWithout so much as a single passer-by.\nThe commotion and din of the children had vanished. Logically speaking, it was impossible for children of that age to all instantly disappear without a sound like that.\nLu Sheng was confident in himself. He was, after all, trained in the Black Tiger Saber and could even detect the position of wild wolves just by listening to the wind. And yet, he did not even hear the sound of the children leaving.\nStaring at the desolate and deathly street, a chill went down his spine. He quickly walked towards the Goldfish Restaurant.\n\"Pitter, patter…\"\nThe sounds of his footsteps rang clearer than usual. The more he approached the restaurant, the more he felt a warm sensation on his entire body.\nWhoosh!!\nAll of a sudden, as if he had just broken through the water surface, Lu Sheng felt everything come to life around him, brimming with life and energy.\nOne by one, warm-bodied customers passed by beside him. One of them accidentally knocked into him and hurried to apologize.\nLadies were alighting from horse carriages, smiling as they walked slowly into the restaurant and were led in by waiters.\nStanding before the restaurant, Lu Sheng looked back on the street selling cosmetic goods again. Without knowing when, it was now filled with some passers-by who weren’t there previously.\nIt was worlds apart from the desertedness before.\nLu Sheng sucked in a mouthful of cold air and swiftly hailed a horse carriage.\n\"To the Lu Manor!\"\n\"Alrighty, please sit tight!\"\nWith a whip from the carriage driver, a skinny old horse slowly moved its hooves.\nSeated on the carriage, Lu Sheng’s mind was occupied by what he had encountered.\nThe hawker, the group of children… they were all very abnormal.\n‘Thinking about it now, the smile on the hawker’s face didn’t move a single inch. It felt extremely fake.’\nHis thoughts led towards the terrible Xu family case and, suddenly, the sense of an impending disaster washed over him.\n\"This city is really getting more and more dangerous…\" he mumbled.\nThe horse carriage pulled up shortly outside the Lu Manor gates. Upon seeing Lu Sheng in the carriage, the gatekeeper hurried over.\n\"Young Master, you’ve returned?\"\nThe gatekeeper was surnamed Wang and was the eighth oldest among his siblings. Everybody usually called him Little Eight. He was a smart lad and had only turned seventeen this year. He inherited his father’s job as the gatekeeper of Lu Manor.\nLittle Eight was pretty familiar with Lu Sheng and would often recount the strange rumors and hearsay flying around in and out of the city to him.\nThose were also what Lu Sheng loved to hear.\n\"Is the Old Master in?\" Lu Sheng asked casually after alighting and paying.\n\"Old Master went to the yamen again. The Prefect summoned him.

He could hear a young girl speak in a soft and gentle voice beside him.\nOutside the carriage was a sea of buzz and commotion. Hawkers were trying to sell their goods, people were yelling and others exclaiming. Children were making a din.\nLu Sheng heaved a deep sigh.\nHe knew he could no longer go back. He was originally a seasoned player in a state-owned enterprise. However, he’d gotten drunk, and when he woke up from his stupor, he found himself in this present world.\nIt had been five days since then.\nHe sniffed at the air, smelling a wafting aroma of wine, mixed with the fragrance of pies and fried nuts.\n\"Sigh… The Osmanthus Winery’s white osmanthus wine is getting more and more fragrant,\" the personal servant girl in the carriage, Little Qiao, whispered in a childish voice.\nLittle Qiao was only twelve this year, but with her natural dollish features and petite figure, she looked no different from a ten-year-old.\nHer small, chubby face carried a natural blush. She donned a small green cotton skirt and her hands were now rubbing a hair tie she was preparing to tie up Lu Sheng’s hair with when they alighted.\nThis kind of hair tie was made of the expensive bark of a species of rubber tree which emanated a light fragrance. The only bad thing about it was that it stiffened when the weather got cold and needed to be warmed and softened by rubbing it with warm hands.\nLu Sheng laughed and kept silent. Meanwhile, the carriage quickly came to a stop.\nHe pulled back the carriage’s veil and alighted, stepping onto the greyish white street covered with bluestone tiles, each as big as a face basin.\nOn the street, carriages and horses led by people travelled in either direction. Hawkers chatted with ladies who were out on a stroll, and wives appeared in public and laughed without care or restraint, peals of laughter resounding incessantly on the street.\nLu Sheng raised his head and saw the winery ahead. On a white rectangular signboard, three giant words danced – The Osmanthus Winery.\n\"Young Master Lu, you’re here! Come in, please! Room A has been reserved for you!\" A servant greeted them with a welcoming smile.\nLu Sheng nodded. From Little Qiao’s hands, he received a silver-bordered white paper fan and shook it open like a rich young master. A scenery of mountains and a river intertwined with each other was painted onto the fan, and a poem had been written on the side. It was clearly the work of a great literati.\nHe followed the servant into the familiar winery.\nIt was divided into two stories. The hall on the first story was presently filled with many of those who were listening to song performances.\nA young lady dressed in green stood in the middle of the empty space, her clear voice twisting and turning melodiously. Beside her, a middle-aged woman was playing a lute.\nThe song being performed was called Three Meetings, a tragic love story about a general on a mission of conquest and a fox lady in the mountain wilderness.\nBut it was a shame that those present were a boorish bunch, and only few somewhat cultured ones among them were barely able to understand the song. The rest of them treated the two ladies like thin air.\nThose who tipped were even fewer.\nLu Sheng paused. Seeing how lively it was, he sat down on an empty seat on the first story.\n\"Who picked Three Meetings?\" He asked the servant casually.\nHe held an uncommon status here in The Osmanthus Winery. Had it been an upscale place of entertainment on Earth, he would have been a VVIP guest: a patron whose annual spending was at least in five digits.\nIn a small northern city like this Nine Links City, such spending was enough to make one a VVIP customer.\n\"It’s Young Master Zhou. Young Master Zhou Que,\" the servant replied softly.\nNot intending to make things difficult for him, Lu Sheng dismissed him with a wave of his hand.\nAfter pulling Little Qiao down onto a seat, his gaze swept the crowd on the first story and quickly landed on a pale and frail gentleman clad in white robes. He was fanning himself lightly with an ugly gold fan he held in his hand.\n\"I bet he’s targeting that young girl who’s singing,\" Lu Sheng shook his head.\n\"Young Master just warned him last time. That lad’s really a rotten egg!\" Little Qiao pouted angrily. [1]\nLu Sheng smiled and no longer said anything. He started listening to the song quietly.\nDishes soon filled the top of the mahogany table. Lu Sheng grabbed some stir-fried meat slices with lettuce and started eating.\nHe also drank a mouthful of white osmanthus wine, drinking it as if it were a normal beverage. The faint and sweet floral fragrance mixed up in it made it taste like fruit juice.\n‘Food and clothing fit for royalty, without any lack or want, and I’ve even got a pretty servant girl to warm my bed… this lifestyle is way too decadent,’ sometimes, Lu Sheng would think about simply living the rest of his life this way. The pursuit of his previous life was to eat, drink and laze around anyway.\nHe ate another mouthful of dishes, and drank another mouthful of wine. Then, he opened his mouth so Little Qiao could put in a salted ice prawn she had just shelled.\nThose ice prawns were the local specialty of this snowy northern city. Just a casual scoop in a thick ice hole would draw up a large amount of translucent prawns.\nThose were ice prawns.\nThey were half the length of a normal prawn but were a fresh delicacy. The meat melted instantly in one’s mouth, serving up an indescribable gastronomic pleasure.\nOf course, it was extremely pricey.\nIt was already considered extravagant for an average person to eat it once a month. Who could enjoy it during every meal like him?\nLu Sheng enjoyed the delicacies and wine before him while listening to the song, but his mind was elsewhere.\nHe had already arrived in this ancient China-like world for so many days. Yet, according to his observations, this world was riddled with many strange happenings.\nInitially, he’d thought that he had gone back into the ancient times, but later he discovered otherwise.\nThe customs, the habits, the weather and the climate here were all vastly different from those during the times of any other dynasty or in any place that he knew of.\nAs he was thinking of these things, the winery’s main doors opened again.\nA group of muscular men dressed in short robes filed in, finding a table near the corner and sitting down immediately.\nThese muscular men were clearly not locals. Their dressing indicated that they seemed to have come from the Central Plains. Neither their clothing nor bearing were as rough as the northerners.\n\"Ai…\"\nThe leader among them was a bald man with bronze earrings and a fierce-looking face. Yet here he was, sighing.\n\"The days are getting worse.\"\n\"Don’t worry, big brother. If we can’t go past Lee Village, we’ll just take the second route. Skirting around Zhang Village will work, too,\" another man said with a frown.\n\"What do you know? I came to meet up with you guys precisely via that route. They’re not much better off than the people at Lee Village… there’s plenty of dead there too,\" the bald man’s fierce-looking face trembled and turned even more sorrowful.\n\"What on earth happened? Tell us big brother, so we can learn a thing or two,\" a man urged.\nThe bald muscular man sighed again. \"I don’t know the specifics either. I just know that quite a few fishing villages by the Sui Yang Lake have been affected. Seems like a water ghost has been haunting them.\"\n\"Water ghost!? No way!\"\nLu Sheng’s table was not far from them and he could hear their conversation which they made no effort to conceal.\nAt first, he was simply listening for fun, but little did he expect that those men started chatting about some superstitious things.\nThe Lu family in his present life was one of the several most wealthy families in this snowy northern city. Saying that they lived high off the hog would be an understatement.\nIf it was on Earth, they would be at least billionaires.\nDuring those past few days, coming out for a drink, he had heard more than a few rumors about demons, spirits, gods and ghosts in the winery. But they were largely gossip.\nThis was the first case that involved people who had a personal encounter, so Lu Sheng raised his ears and eavesdropped attentively on their conversation.\nIt was a good thing that they did not hush it up. They continued chatting loudly about the strange occurrences in the fishing villages.\n\"That water ghost… I saw it with my own eyes… it was over ten feet tall, with a green face and fangs, covered with lots of seaweed. Oh my goodness, if I, your big brother, didn’t run fast enough, you wouldn’t be able to see me now,\" the bald man was still having the shivers as he recalled it.\n\"Big brother, is the water ghost real?\" One of them was skeptical.\n\"Are you sure you didn’t make up this story?\" Another of them sneered.\nHaving heard to this point, Lu Sheng found it funny too. It was probably another boast by some boor from god-knows-where. He had seen many of his kind in this world.\nHaving eaten something and drunk some wine, he made a servant bring over the singing lady’s song list and casually looked it over.\nThree Meetings was not bad, but didn’t suit the atmosphere. He wanted to change it to a more joyous tune.\n\"PA!\"\nBut, right at that moment, the bald man slapped the table with his palm, his face now red.\n\"You really think that I, Boss Hu, only knows how to boast!? Look, look at what this is! That’s a piece of bone left behind by the water ghost! I secretly picked it up after the incident!\"\nHe retrieved a piece of jade-like green stone gingerly from his chest and slapped the tabletop with it.\n\"Isn’t that just a piece of mixed jade?\" One of them sneered.\n\"Mixed jade? This is mixed jade?! Go eat crap!\" The bald man’s face was red with rage.\n\"This brother over here. Can you show me that thing?\"\nA mild voice rang out from the side suddenly.\nLu Sheng was standing beside their table with a smile on his face. His gaze swept across the green piece of jade on the tabletop.\n\"This thing… you dare to take it? This was left behind by a water ghost,\" the bald man remarked in surprise.\nHe had merely taken it out to show it off for a while and was planning to throw it away a little later.\nAfter all, it was left behind by something inhuman. If it led the water ghost to him, he would really be in deep trouble.\n\"It’s ok. I just want to take a look,\" Lu Sheng did not believe in any tale about a water ghost. It just seemed to him that the piece of jade would sell well; it looked different from your average jade.\nThe average mixed jade could be purchased from shops and stalls everywhere. It was casually polished from jadeite corners and was extremely cheap.\nBut, for some strange reason, the moment he saw this piece of jade, he knew something was different about it.\nThe bald Boss Hu glanced at Lu Sheng and saw that he carried an extraordinary aura about him, dressed in clothes worn by the rich.\nHe wore a green robe and a white fox fur jacket. On his head was a jade officer hat, and on his feet, there were black-soled shoes with cloud patterns embroidered on them with silver threads.\nThe cost of his entire outfit was enough to pay for a few months’ worth of spending at The Osmanthus Winery... and probably enough to equal an average household’s annual expenditure as well.\n\"Well, Young Master, if you want it, er… just a talent of silver will do!\" The muscular man ventured after some hesitation.\n\"Deal,\" Lu Sheng let Little Qiao take out a talent of silver and place it on the table.\n\"It’s yours now,\" the bald man took the jade and stuffed it in Lu Sheng’s hands decisively. The few of them exchanged glances with each other, rose from the table and left.\nWithout another word, Lu Sheng watched them leave. He held up the jade in his hand for a closer examination.\n‘A talent of silver. If this was China on Earth, then we’re talking about a thousand Chinese dollars’ worth of purchasing power. Only in this life can I spend so extravagantly,’ he shook his head. A talent of silver meant nothing to him. According to the memories of his present body, his average monthly expenditure was at least above a hundred talents of silver. [2]\nOccasionally, he would even spend up to a thousand talents and more. That equaled millions on today’s Earth!\nThinking of this, he complained in his heart about what a prodigal the previous host of this body had been.\nIgnoring the stares of the surrounding onlookers, he held onto the jade, called Little Qiao and left the winery, heading towards the horse carriage waiting outside.\nYet right after stepping out of the winery, before he was even halfway there, he abruptly stood still and placed the jade in the heart of his palm.\nThere and then, in the middle of his right palm, the jade started melting!\nIn a matter of seconds, the originally hard rock dissolved into a pool of dark green goo. A faint but terrible scream came out from the goo.\n\"Poof!\"\nWithout warning, the goo exploded into a ball of green smoke and gradually dispersed in front of Lu Sheng.\nHe stood rooted to the ground in shock. Refocusing his sight, he saw that the jade was still in his palm, but the green sheen within it had vanished silently.\n‘Just now that was…’\nHe stood on the spot blankly, continuously recalling the image he had just seen.\n\"Young Master? Young Master???\" Little Qiao kept calling out beside him.\nLu Sheng snapped out of his reverie and looked at the jade in his hand once again. It was now nothing more than an ordinary cobblestone; not even a vestige of jade remained.\nHair stood on the back of his neck. Imperceptibly, he seemed to understand something.\n\"Let’s go. Back to the manor!\"\nLittle Qiao blinked and took a while to react. \"Okay…\"\nBoth of them boarded the carriage. The driver gave a few whips and two black hairy horses began to advance slowly.\nIn the carriage, Lu Sheng did not make a sound. He just kept staring at the cobblestone in his palm. At this point, Little Qiao too discovered the change in the stone.\n‘We got scammed again!’ She muttered in her heart but did not say much. ‘Young Master’s considered alright this time. The biggest scam he fell for in the past was that supposedly ancient wine flask. It cost over a thousand silver talents and almost drove Old Master to his grave. It’s just a talent of silver this time. Sometimes Young Master’s meal costs more than that.’\nThe horse carriage headed straight for the manor. As it passed by the city gates, Lu Sheng heard shouts from the outside.\n\"…I heard a while back that the water ghost has been exorcized! A travelling priest saved the fishing villages from danger!\"\n\"Has the court sent anyone?\"\n\"Yeah, already quite some time ago. I heard even the prefectural yamen’s Chief Constable Ouyang almost lost his life. Good thing he met a travelling priest. According to the news, when the priest attacked, there was a blinding golden flash and the water ghost cried out pathetically before turning into green goo. Afterward, it just exploded into thick smoke and then dispersed.\" [3]\n\"So it wasn’t attacked by the court’s experts?\"\n\"Of course not!\"\nLu Sheng could tell that it was the officers on guard duty chit-chatting.\nHe would often intentionally pass by the gates on this side of the city. The soldiers on guard duty were well-informed of the latest news and loved to brag and bullshit about strange news from all over the region.\n‘What a coincidence…’ Lu Sheng’s face betrayed nothing.\nRecalling that piece of jade from earlier, his heart sank.\nMeanwhile, the horse carriage lumbered on toward Ku Rong Street – the most prosperous part of the city.\n[1] ED/N: Before Lu Sheng was addressed \"young master\", whereas here the servant girl adds the character for \"big\", which has a more respectful sound to it. While I’m not a TL so I can’t tell for sure with my much worse Chinese, it seems to mean that he’s the oldest son of his parents (which is a fact) or the oldest youth in his generation in his family (branch families likely do not count). It could also mean that he’s the first in line to inherit the family head’s position. Later on, she’ll also use this form of address (but also at least one more word that also translates to \"young master\"). There are many ways to say \"young master\" in Chinese, but we’ll always translate them as \"young master\" (sometimes we’ll use capital letters to emphasize the instances where it’s a translation of a more respectful Chinese version).\n[2] ED/N: Chinese dollars = Yuan = Renminbi.

Yesterday, Old Master called all heads of the businesses here, both minor and major, for a meeting. As they were leaving, I heard them say that everyone will have to help find it together. I wonder what it is, to go so far as to call all those big shots to help,\" Little Eight smiled as he thought about the matter.\nLu Sheng said nothing in response. However, he put on a rather gloomy expression. He walked past the main door to enter inside. As he walked, he asked him another question. \"Has anything strange happened lately?\"\n\"Er… Young Master, although Little Eight is considered well-informed, how can strange things happen everyday?\" Little Eight shrugged his shoulders helplessly. [1]\n\"Although… I heard that there was a big fire that broke out last night at the Goldfish Restaurant that you frequent. Half the side street was burnt away! Even though we servants were a long way off, we could still see the flames very distinctly from far away.\"\n\"A big fire…\"\nLu Sheng’s heart sank. He had a faint guess.\n\"Are you talking about that street that often sells cosmetic powders during the day?\"\n\"Precisely, just that!\" Little Eight nodded vigorously, \"I hear that quite a number of people died. Some of them were entire families, including the young and the old. It’s really awful… I wonder which heartless creature set the fire!\"\n‘A big fire…’\nLu Sheng said nothing more. He suppressed the matter deep within his heart and stopped thinking about it.\nThe Black Meeting was arranged to be at night in three days’ time, in a cellar outside the city.\nIn these three days, Lu Sheng rested and ate each day as usual. He could clearly feel his body growing sturdier, as if the Black Tiger Saber altered by the Modifier had also improved his physical state itself.\nIn those three days, he paid the street near Goldfish Restaurant a visit yet again. Sure enough, it was all charred and burnt. Quite a few people could be even seen being busy at rebuilding new houses.\nLu Sheng walked back along the road that he had gone before. It was exactly the same as he had seen the other day.\nEven that dead end of a back alley was just as it had been.\nHe now had a few guesses in mind, but did not feel fearful or anxious.\nSince there were water ghosts in this world, then naturally, other things could also exist.\nHe had initially intended to get initiated in that Jade Force on the ripped manual which he had bought during these three days, and then to modify it. However, as he thought of the Black Meeting, he decided to hold back for now. If he injured himself badly and spat out blood after modification again, he would lose this opportunity.\nTime passed by quickly. In the blink of an eye, it was the day of the appointment.\nIt was around seven or eight at night.\nLu Sheng changed into a set of black robes and put on the mask of a tiger. It was a toy for children that he had casually bought off the streets, and was very crudely made.\nIn front of the Lu Manor entrance, the Zheng Family’s horse carriage was already waiting.\nHe hurriedly boarded the horse carriage. Zheng Xiangui was currently sitting inside, biting off big chunks of meat from the braised chicken thigh he held in both his hands.\nThis fatso also wore a set of black robes. However, it didn't really matter – anyone could tell from his exaggerated physique that this guy was the Young Master of the faction hosting the Black Meeting.\n\"Good, you’re here, we’re just waiting for you. Brother Sheng, hurry, get on the carriage.\"\nBoth men sat down and the horse carriage slowly began to move.\nZheng Xiangui advised Lu Sheng throughout the journey on the dos and don’ts after entry, a whole host of messy details to pay attention to. Still, Lu Sheng committed each of them to his memory.\nSoon, they left the city. They travelled along a main road, from which they took a twist into a side road, then meandered along for quite a distance before heading directly into the outskirts.\nAfter travelling along the outskirts for a while, the horse carriage approached a little village tucked away in an overgrown wilderness area. It stopped in front of a stone house in the middle of the village.\n\"This is it,\" Zheng Xiangui jumped off the carriage. A black-robed man standing guard at the door of the stone house came forward and greeted him.\n\"Everybody’s present?\"\n\"Everybody’s present. The first auction item is already being displayed.\"\nZheng Xiangui nodded, anxiously urging, \"Let’s hurry inside, it’s already started.\"\nHe pulled Lu Sheng into the stone house. He opened a wooden door on the floor in the middle of the stone house, revealing a flight of stairs that led underground.\nLu Sheng followed behind Zheng Xiangui and two other guards down the stairs. At the bottom was a karst cave with a rather large surface area.\nThe karst cave was even prepared rather decently.\nThere was a big hall in the middle. In the surrounding stone walls was a circle of side rooms, each of them looking like little packets hanging on the walls.\nA few people were seated sparsely in the big hall. No firelight came from the surrounding little packets; clearly, they were not in use.\n\"Wow, this place has a rather huge layout,\" Lu Sheng exclaimed.\n\"Hehe, we discovered this place accidentally,\" the fatso said laughingly. He brought Lu Sheng in from the back of the big hall, and headed for the seats in the front row.\nOnly a little more than ten people in total attended the Black Meeting this time. They all sat scattered around the first row.\nA tall, skinny man whose face was veiled was standing on the stage. Currently, he was introducing the details of the item being auctioned in a loud voice.\nNext to him stood two dwarves. Both of them wore bright garish floral garments and held a bronze plate in their hands between them. There was a dagger on the plate, brown and spotty from rust.\n\"An ancient dagger passed down from Ju Rong Nation, most likely forged by Duan Fengzi of the olden days! There are some words carved on it in the national language of Ju Rong Nation, even if… aye! Guest No. Four bids one thousand talents! Any higher bids? Any higher bids!?\" The man on the stage yelled loudly with an extremely animated expression.\nLu Sheng and Zheng Xiangui sat on the seats to the left.\nThe rows of seats here all seemed to be carved out of white stone. It was extremely cold to the touch, emitting completely no warmth.\nFatso sat right next to him. He cocked his head and whispered, \"What you want is the fifth item, the second to last one.\"\nLu Sheng nodded his head wordlessly.\nClearly, the dagger on the stage had just been dug up from the ground not too long ago. It was perhaps found by a grave robber.\nThere were still quite a few people competing for it below. In just a short while, the bid for the dagger had risen to one thousand eight hundred talents.\nLu Sheng’s heart beat quickly as he listened to the proceedings. This was already twice the equivalent of his monthly allowance!\nHe did not watch the bidding competition on stage any longer. Instead, he diverted his attention to focus on the guests who were near him.\nMost of the guests to the Black Meeting carried with them weapons, ranging from short to long in size. Moreover, most of them were dressed in black and disguised, though there were also exceptions.\nOf the more than ten guests who were present, there were three who did not conceal their identity.\nOne of them was a man with red hair who wore a fitting yellow leather armor and carried a broadsword on his back.\nAnother was a very short, skinny and seemingly weak youth who had a beak-like mouth and sunken cheeks. Tied to his waist were two bulging black leather pouches that carried god-knew-what.\nThe third one was the most eye-catching.\nOr rather, it was a pair. A man and a woman.\nThe man’s clothes and a sword he carried on his waist conveyed a sense of strength; he seemed to be a bodyguard. He held an indifferent look that only softened for a bit when he gazed upon the woman.\nThe woman wore a black dress that was not one of the typical long dresses that women in ancient times wore. It was a tight dress whose hem and its surroundings looked like a body-hugging miniskirt that one would see on Earth.\nFrom head to toe, there was only that one piece body-hugging dress which barely covered her rear. Just a slightly bigger movement of lifting her legs would clearly reveal the space between her two legs.\nThis woman dressed sexily. She had long legs and a slender waist; a pair of white weapons at her chest threatened to tear the dress apart, looking as if at any moment the dress would burst at the seams near the chest area.\nLu Sheng could not help but look at the woman’s face.\nShe had a very high nose bridge and a pair of charming and glittering eyes that seemed to always be smiling. Her long black hair fell on her shoulders, so smooth and shining that they seemed to reflect a bit of light.\n‘This is so much more effective than any so-called Photoshop makeup technique,’ Lu Sheng praised in his heart.\nOne could tell that this woman was someone influential with a mere glance. Only one who was absolutely confident in one’s strength would dare to show such a beautiful face so freely at the Black Meeting.\n\"That’s Duan Muwan,\" seeing Lu Sheng’s attention had been attracted by the woman, Fatso promptly leaned in to whisper the introduction. \"But I don't recommend you trying to pick her up. This woman is beyond fierce!\"\n\"Fierce? How so?\"\nLu Sheng was mildly curious, but he did not have any designs on her. It was just that the woman was simply too eye-catching, so he was sizing her up.\nFatty smiled a little and looked towards the stage, at the second auction item that had already appeared.\n\"Duan Muwan came to Nine Links City about two months ago. I heard that she came along with a merchant group. The two of them, master and servant, joined the group by themselves. To walk such a long distance in itself is already not easy.\"\n\"Indeed, it’s no easy feat,\" Lu Sheng nodded.\n\"Moreover, because of her natural beauty, this woman has been very promiscuous since coming to Nine Links City. Quite a number of handsome young masters have been seduced by her and then, guess what happened?\" Fatso shook his head and sighed.\n\"What?\" Lu Sheng asked, his curiosity now piqued.\n\"All the young masters were infatuated beyond reason, resulting in a massive melee, which resulted in quite a number of injured and even quite a few killed,\" fatso said as he clicked his tongue.\n\"Even so, those who were seriously injured and handicapped remain devoted to this woman. But she’s already forgotten them in the blink of an eye!\"\nLu Sheng narrowed his eyes, a shiver in his heart. He had heard of these incidents, but never imagined that this woman was the cause of them all. For them to pine for her even after they were handicapped… this was not something that could be explained by her beauty.\nIn that moment, he labeled Duan Muwan as extremely dangerous in his mind. For her to be able to twist so many people around her little finger, she either had extremely high EQ or employed some unusual methods. It was best to stay as far away as possible from such characters.\nHe refocused his attention on the auction on the stage.\nIt was already the fourth auction item’s turn now: a yellow-bronze half-body leather armor.\n\"This leather armor is the Ice Wolf Armor, made of the combined, tanned hide of nineteen white wolves of the Ice White Grasslands. Nineteen layers of wolf hide are now as thin as a copper coin after tanning. Its resistance against both blunt tools and swords far exceeds that of a normal leather armor. It’s almost the same as wearing another layer of chainmail armor!\" The black-robed man exclaimed loudly to introduce this piece of leather armor.\n\"Starting bid price is two hundred talents!\"\nSilence. No one moved.\nThe host didn't seem to mind it very much. He got one of the dwarves to hold the leather armor before personally taking out a dagger and violently piercing into its side.\n\"Thud!\"\nA muffled sound rang out as the dagger slid off. Surprisingly, only a small scratch remained on the leather armor.\n\"Three hundred talents!\" Seeing that, someone immediately placed a bid.\n\"Four hundred talents!\"\n\"Six hundred talents!\"\nThe bids continued to rise higher and higher. Lu Sheng himself was rather moved when he saw it. This sort of leather armor was both lightweight and nimble, and was more convenient and flexible than the metal armor as it did not affect one’s movements. If its defense was really as strong as stated, then it indeed was a valuable item.\nHe wanted to state a price, but seeing that the bids arrived at almost one thousand talents in the blink of an eye, he could only restrain himself and give it up. His true goal was still the next item: the manual.\nHe could not lose sight of the big picture for this small item.\nIn the end, the leather armor was bought by the red-haired man with the broadsword on his back.

The Lu Manor was one of the houses there.\nThe horse carriage headed straight down Ku Rong Street and entered into a garden area.\nThis area was surrounded by greyish-white stone walls, forming a huge oval shape.\nOn the left of the area was where the Lu Manor was located.\nThe manor was the very image of quiet and tranquility, with black doors flanked by red lanterns and two stone chimeras, now covered with a white layer of snow.\nThe horse carriage stopped at the entrance of the Lu Manor, where Lu Sheng alighted. People within the mansion had long since heard the sound of him approaching and unhurriedly opened the doors. A chamberlain awaited at the entrance.\nAs soon as Lu Sheng and Little Qiao passed through the doors, they saw a good-looking man and a woman standing together on a stone bridge to the right of the residence.\nThe man was dashing, confident and with a brilliant countenance. He had sharp brows and sparkling eyes, and there was a thick aura of a Confucian scholar around him.\nThe woman looked soft and gentle, her eyes beautiful as if taken from a painting. She had slender waist and long legs; her manner was that of a well-bred girl from a wealthy family.\nSeeing the two of them, Lu Sheng’s train of thought was briefly interrupted. His mood lifted somewhat, and took the initiative to go over to greet them.\n\"Elder Brother Xu, why are you here only today? My little cousin has missed you for the past days,\" he smiled as he walked on the stone bridge.\nThe man smiled as he turned and caught sight of Lu Sheng. \"So it’s Young Master Sheng. Earlier, I had to follow orders to investigate into something, a case which had just been resolved. I came to see Yiyi as soon as I could. Don’t blame me for this, I couldn’t disobey orders from the higher ups.\"\n\"A case? Has there recently been a case so big that Elder Brother Xu needed to personally take care of it?\" Lu Sheng knew that Elder Brother Xu Daoran was of a high position.\nHe was a County Lord who was overall in charge of law and order in all of the counties within Nine Links City area.\nThe position of a County Lord was second only to that of the County Magistrate, and was akin to that of a Police Commissioner.\n\"Just some cases in the fishing villages, but they’ve been resolved,\" Xu Daoran smiled warmly. \"Although, Little Sheng, when are you coming to help me? You promised me previously that you would come to help me out in planning for the city’s law and order.\"\nHow could Lu Sheng remember everything this body’s previous host had promised in the past? He gave a perfunctory laugh and hurried to change the subject.\n\"Fishing villages? Don't tell me it has to do with the rumored water ghost?\"\n\"What water ghost! It was just a lunatic driven to madness by his desire for revenge who went on a killing spree. I have already beheaded him at the scene!\" Xu Daoran shook his head and said indifferently. \"The case has been resolved, let’s not dampen our spirits by harping on these matters. Little Sheng, do you still remember what I promised Yiyi previously?\"\n\"To offer joss-sticks in Red Lotus Temple, and take a hike while you’re at it?\" Lu Sheng swiftly replied with a smile.\n\"You sure remember these play things very well,\" Xu Daoran helplessly replied and added, \"You’re no longer young… nineteen-year-old this year, was it? You should find some work to do. You can't expect to live the rest of your life like this, can you?\"\nHe had watched Lu Sheng grow up. Because their families had been long-time friends, he had always seen Lu Sheng as his younger brother.\nNow, he felt that he had to offer a few words of advice.\nLu Sheng shook his head and laughed. \"Elder Brother Xu, do you want me to become an official, or a businessman?\"\n\"An official, of course. This is also your father’s wish. Your maternal and paternal uncles both hope that you can come over and help them as soon as possible. After all, you’re the eldest son of the Lu family,\" Xu Daoran persuaded.\n\"Let’s not talk about this first. It’s not urgent, not urgent at all! I’m still young. What logic is there behind this hurry to chase the eldest son out?\" Unconcerned, Lu Sheng replied randomly in a casual tone.\nXu Daoran and Lu Yiyi were both speechless, and did not continue the topic.\nLu Sheng did not want to dwell on the subject of being an official. He changed the subject, and walked off with Little Qiao in the direction of his sleeping quarters.\nOnce he got there, he changed his clothes. Without even going to greet his father, he then took the piece of cobblestone and went alone to the garden at the back of the manor.\nXu Daoran was born in the Xu family which, like the Lu family, was one of the most illustrious families in this northern city that is Nine Links. Their members had far-reaching influence, and held important positions in all areas of the city.\nLu Sheng felt rather kindly disposed towards Xu Daoran; he was a sincere and honest guy, without selfish motives, and was genuinely interested in Yiyi.\nTo Lu Sheng, he was as close as an elder brother.\nExcept…\nLu Sheng grasped onto the cobblestone, once again thinking back to the earlier scene. He thought back to what he had incidentally heard at the city gates, about how the water ghost had been killed.\n‘In this world, are there ghosts and immortals…?’\nThere was a faint, indescribable gloom in his heart as he gazed at the snow swirling in the garden.\n‘Perhaps it’s just as Elder Brother Xu said... it’s just a false rumor spread by the people,’ he shook his head, grasping onto a thread of wishful thinking in his heart.\nEarly in the evening, he returned to his room to wash and sleep. The day’s events had left him befuddled. With so many things on his mind, he quickly grew tired.\nHe slept through the night, up until sunrise.\n\"DONG DONG DONG! DONG DONG DONG!\"\nThe sound of frantic knocks arose.\nLu Sheng abruptly opened his eyes, shot up from the bed and looked towards the door.\n\"Who is it?!\"\n\"Young Master...! There’s been trouble...!\" It was Little Qiao’s voice.\nLu Sheng hurriedly got off his bed to open the door. Outside, Little Qiao stood there with a terrifyingly pale face, devoid of all color. The fat cheeks on her baby face were currently trembling uncontrollably.\n\"Xu… Xu… Xu…\"\nSeeing this, an ominous sense of crisis began to rise in Lu Sheng’s heart.\n\"Just what happened? Take a deep breath!\" He raised his hand to pat Little Qiao’s back vigorously.\nOnly then was Little Qiao able to breathe normally.\n\"The Xu family… Lord Xu’s family’s all finished!!\" She said in one breath, sobbing.\nLu Sheng was stupefied.\nLittle Qiao speedily helped Lu Sheng into his outer robes. Without saying another word, they both sped towards the outer manor.\nThe patriarch of the Lu family, Lu Fang, was standing outside the manor. He had his hands behind his back, a hint of a tremble on his crestfallen face.\nThree huge black double horse carriages waited next to him.\nLu Sheng, along with his other cousins within the manor, hastily paid respects to Lu Fang before promptly boarding the carriages.\nLu Fang and Lu Sheng sat together, father and son both silent as they faced each other. Neither spoke a word while on the carriage.\nLu Fang was over sixty years of age. With a white beard, skinny build and handsome features, he looked more like a distinguished scholar rather than a businessman.\nThe horse carriages advanced without slowing down. It wasn't long till they arrived outside the Nine Links City’s gates.\nLu Sheng alighted from the carriage, and was shocked by the scene before his eyes.\nTo the left of the carriageway outside the city gates, ten corpses lay neatly on the snow. From young to old, from men to women… they were all of the Xu family!\nAll of them were clad in robes custom-made for the Xu household. Xu Daoran lay in the middle of the third row.\nHis face was ashen, his body stiff and eyes shut tightly. His expression was one of extreme fear, just as if he had seen something immensely terrifying before his death.\nLu Sheng saw the constables maintaining order at the scene. He saw his own father, Lu Fang, standing in front of an old man’s corpse, not saying a word with his fists clenched tightly.\nThe Prefect, having heard the news, was also present, his face as white as the snow surrounding them.\nLu Sheng took a deep breath and walked slowly to stand next to a constable. \"How did they die?\"\nThat constable recognized him and knew who he was. He sighed.\n\"All of them died in their own manor, hung by seaweed from the house beams. No idea where the seaweed came from…\"\n\"Yiyi! Yiyi!!\"\nA cry of alarm suddenly sounded out from behind. Obviously, little cousin Yiyi had fainted.\nLu Sheng heaved a deep sigh, recalling what Xu Daoran had said to him only the day before.\nHe had just returned from solving cases in the fishing villages…\nFishing villages…\nWater ghost…\nThat bizarre piece of cobblestone…\nIn that moment, many thoughts went through Lu Sheng’s mind.\nIn actuality, he had only been in this world for a couple of days, and did not have any deep attachment to Xu Daoran. Therefore, he only felt a sense of regret and shock at the moment. However, he did not feel the grief others would have expected of him.\nIt’s not that he had never seen corpses before.\nRather, it’s just that he had never seen this many corpses before.\n\"Where is Priest Chi Ling of the Xu household?\" He heard Lu Fang asking the senior constable.\n\"In another area. The corpse has been split into many chunks, one of which has even been gnawed at by a beast…\" the senior constable replied in a low voice.\nA spell of silence.\nBe it the Lu family, the Prefect or the commoners looking on from the city gates, they were all silent.\n\"Priest Chi Ling is quick with his sword, and is even a cut above Uncle Zhao…\" Lu Fang gradually lowered his voice.\nUncle Zhao was the strongest martial arts master employed by the Lu family. Priest Chi Ling was stronger than Uncle Zhao, and yet he was killed.\nThis was no longer a simple murder case, but a grave danger that was enough to threaten everyone present!\nOf all the people present, who would dare say that he was mightier than the Xu family?\nNo one would dare say so, not even the Prefect.\nLu Sheng stood silently on the roadside. He’d initially thought that this world was very safe and was but an imitation of the ancient China, that’s all. There were some surprising occurrences, but nothing too serious.\nBut now, it seemed…\nHe touched the cobblestone that was in his sleeve pocket.\nThe cobblestone was shockingly hot at the moment.\nHe took out the cobblestone, hesitated for a bit, and then lightly threw it away.\nThis item might just bring calamity upon him.\nThe Xu family had a foundation as robust as his own Lu family, and yet was entirely wiped out in the span of a single night.\nThis caused Lu Sheng to be greatly alarmed in his heart.\nHe deliberated, and suddenly walked over to the right of the cobblestone, bent over, and picked it up.\n\"Psss.\"\nUnknowingly, his forefinger had been accidentally cut by wild grass jutting out from the snow-covered ground.\nIt was a special kind of grass. The sides of its leaves were sharp as the edge of a blade.\nLu Sheng’s finger was immediately sliced and bled, a few drops of blood dripping onto the cobblestone.\n\"Young Master?\" Little Qiao followed closely behind him, somewhat anxious, with tears streaming down her small face. Clearly, Xu Daoran’s death was a huge blow to her.\nLu Sheng’s body was frozen on the spot.\nA series of extremely unique syllables suddenly floated across his mind.\n\"Welcome to the Deep Blue Skills Cheating Device.\"\nIn a moment, Lu Sheng’s eyes went into a daze. Quite a while passed before he was back to himself.\nHe stared at the translucent, bluish square frame floating before his eyes. Astonishingly, in it he could see his name and all skills he currently mastered.\n‘Isn’t this… the little cheating device I wrote for a mobile phone app?!’\nLu Sheng felt like he was going mad, having one hallucination after another.\nIt was bad enough that he had been reincarnated into this Young Master of a wealthy family, who barely had the strength to truss a chicken. As if that wasn’t enough, he was actually having all sorts of hallucinations now!\nIn his previous life, he had downloaded a little game called Chronicles of Flying Swords and Heroes when he was bored. However, because the game was too difficult, he had programmed a simple cheating device to modify his martial arts in the game.\nHe had named it the Deep Blue Cheating Device. Come to think of it, the voice he had heard earlier was his own, recorded through a voice-changing device.\nNever did he expect…\nLu Sheng looked resolutely into the space within the square frame.\nThe space was remarkably simple.

Or not a hallucination?’\nLu Sheng’s eyes narrowed. He suppressed the doubts in his heart.\n\"I’m fine,\" he replied calmly, straightening his back.\n\"Young Master… Lord Xu and the rest, they all were such good men. Such good officials. How can it be…?\" Little Qiao’s eyes welled up with tears and she started crying.\nLu Sheng stared silently at the Xu family corpses that lay on the floor.\nAll of them were greenish gray and had ligature marks on their necks.\nThe Prefect glanced at them a few times and then left hurriedly, leaving it for the Chief Constable in charge of the case to handle.\nSeveral yamen officials, who were also responsible for investigation, went aside to discuss the case with the Chief Constable.\n\"Young Master, Old Master asks you to come over,\" a servant ran to Lu Sheng and whispered to him while looking sympathetically at the corpses of the Xu family members lying on the ground.\n\"I’ll be right there.\" Lu Sheng glanced at the servant. \"Are you scared?\"\n\"I am scared,\" the servant was merely eighteen or nineteen, yet carried an air of maturity beyond his age about him. \"But, your servant is a refugee from Ju Rong Nation in the east. There’s a famine over there now. Corpses are all over the ground everywhere. Quite a few people even trade their children with each other to eat them. Pitiful scenes like this are commonplace… ai…\"\nHe sighed. But realizing quickly that he was not chatting with one of his friends, he immediately bowed his head.\n\"Commonplace? Are there many of such incidents in Ju Rong nation in the east?\" Lu Sheng asked casually.\nThe servant fell into silence for a moment. \"More than a few.\"\nLu Sheng’s heart tightened.\nWithout a pause in his steps, he quickly walked to the father of his present self – Lu Fang.\nLu Fang. Other name – Quanan, a.k.a. the Golden Dollar Man.\nLu Quanan’s wealth was famous even in the entire Nine Links City. News that the Lu and Xu Family were about to be joined by marriage had also spread throughout the city. Even people from Zi Hua City in the west had come to present their wedding gifts.\nTo think that a topic as hot and event as celebrated as this would come to end in such a manner.\nPresently, Lu Quanan’s face was extremely ugly. Heavy fatigue and worry were visible in his eyes.\n\"Tell Constable Zhao about yesterday’s situation in detail.\"\nHe moved aside to make space for an approaching bearded man.\nIn his mind, Lu Sheng kept replaying what he had heard from Xu Daoran yesterday. He believed that the water ghost case must be related to the Xu Family deaths. So, he recounted his conversation with Xu Daoran the previous day.\nHe didn’t hide anything.\nChief Constable Zhao’s brows knit together. He, too, saw no major clue in the entire affair.\nSeeing that there were no more questions for him, Lu Sheng departed.\nBefore leaving, the yamen’s men began to clean up the corpses.\nLu Sheng stared for a while from the sidelines. When he saw Xu Daoran being lifted up on the stretcher, he sighed and approached a constable nearby and asked,\" Brother, are there any surviving members of the Xu family?\"\nHe thought that if there were any survivors from the Xu family, he would take care of him or her and perhaps even learn some useful information from them.\n\"Nope… they’re all gone. Even their external relatives’ entire families were implicated. Perhaps they’ve still got a few distant relatives in Zi Hua city,\" the constable shook his head and whispered.\nLu Sheng quietly stuffed a silver coin into his hand. Then, taking Little Qiao along with him, he boarded the horse carriage with his family.\nThe horse carriage headed back towards home.\nHowever, the Xu family’s pitiful state was still on everyone’s minds.\nAs the head of the family, Lu Fang aka Lu Quanan assembled everyone for a family meeting and announced that the engagement with Xu family was void from now on and the women were to console Yiyi. Then, he returned by himself to rest in his room.\nOne by one, the young men in the family went out, be it to the winery in the city, or to the brothel and other similar establishments. That was their usual way of numbing themselves to traumatic events.\nAs for the women, they went out to the nearby Red Lotus Temple to pray for peace and protection.\nIdeally, they would come back with a talisman from the Red Lotus priest which would protect the family from invasion by any external evils.\nThe entire Lu family was fraught with fear.\nBut Lu Sheng did not go out. Instead, he brought Little Qiao with him and headed for the library where the family kept its books.\nThe library was in absolute silence. He pushed the doors open and entered to see a plump woman wiping the shelves.\nThe mahogany shelves and furniture as well as the faint light streaming in from the windows gave this place an eerie atmosphere.\nLu Sheng went past the wooden partition blocking the entrance, which featured a circular painting of flowers and birds, sniffing the faint fragrance of wood in the library.\n\"Take your leave first. I’ll read some books by myself and take a rest,\" he instructed.\n\"Yes,\" Little Qiao replied obediently and left together with the plump cleaning woman.\nStanding alone in the library and staring at the rows of shelves before him, Lu Sheng sighed. Then, he began to search the shelves one by one.\nVery quickly, he found some sort of local prefectural record books. Taking all of these books out of the shelves, he began flipping through them one by one.\nUsing the faint light streaming in from the windows, he quickly browsed through one of them from cover to cover.\n\"In the seventy-second year of the Great Song, a man appeared in the outskirts of Nine Links City and slaughtered twelve with a saber in a frenzy. Killed after being surrounded and attacked by yamen constables.\"\n\"In the eighty-fifth year of the Great Song, on the streets in downtown Nine Links City, a man’s head was suddenly separated from his body. Cause of death remains unknown.\"\n\"In the ninety-first year of the Great Song, tourists went missing in the deserted temple outside the city, numbering at least fifteen. Case remains unsolved till the current date.\"\n\"In the ninety-fifth year of the Great Song, the owner of Nine Links City Music Plaza went missing. His limbs were later discovered in four different locations of the city. The corpse had already decomposed into bones despite only four days passing since his death.\"\n\"In the hundred and sixteenth year of the Great Song, a baby’s cry from outside the city was heard at night. Those sent to investigate all went missing. The sounds of crying could be heard for three days before vanishing by themselves.\"\n***\nReading the records of these cases, both big and small, Lu Sheng grew increasingly shocked and terrified. It was deeply unnerving.\nIt was truly no simple feat for people to retain their sanity and live normally in a world like this, grave danger awaiting at every step.\nHe opened another book. It was even more exaggerated than the previous one.\n\"In the hundred and nineteenth year of the Great Song, a blizzard broke out in Nine Links. The Dragon Lord was rumored to have appeared somewhere, causing the snow to stop in three days. Three days later, the blizzard that lasted for more than ten days ended abruptly.\"\n\"In the hundred and twenty-eighth year of the Great Song, fog appeared on the road leading towards Zi Hua City. Those who entered the fog would lose their bearings and appear mysteriously by the coast of the White Frozen Sea several miles away. Ten days later, the fog disappeared.\"\nHaving read till this point, Lu Sheng was almost certain that this world was not as simple as he had thought. Demons, ghosts and monsters probably really existed here.\nAt least he currently knew of no method in this world which could manipulate the weather.\nHe shifted the chair, picked up a flint and lit up the candles on the table. Their bright yellow flame flickered, casting shadows on his face.\n\"If this world is truly as dangerous as I think, then what do I need to protect myself? What can I use to protect myself?\"\nHe asked himself and thought about this question for a moment by the table.\nThen, rising slowly, Lu Sheng blew out the candle and returned all the books on the table to their places on the shelves.\nHe pushed the doors open and stepped out.\n\"Young Master, you’re done reading?\"\nLittle Qiao was dozing off, her back against the door. She was caught by surprise when Lu Sheng suddenly came out, but still reacted quickly.\n\"Mm. Where’s Uncle Zhao now? Do you know?\" Lu Sheng asked casually.\nThere were many surnamed Zhao and of similar age in the Lu Manor, but only one of them was known to all as Uncle Zhao.\nHe was the one whom even Lu Fang addressed as Uncle Zhao, the number one expert and the strongest martial arts master in the Lu family – Zhao Dahu.\n\"Er… at this time of a day Uncle Zhao is usually at the martial arts arena, tempering his bones and training the servants,\" Little Qiao was on good terms with other servants and so was rather well-informed.\n\"Let’s go find him.\"\nLu Sheng thought long and hard. Uncle Zhao was the easiest person within his reach from whom he could learn some self-preservation skills.\nWalking along the path in the manor, Lu Sheng quickly traversed two stretches of sleeping quarters and arrived at the back of the manor.\nAtop a big arena, a white-haired elder was leading more than ten servants in practicing martial arts.\nThe light of the morning sun washed down on them, gradually lightening Lu Sheng’s heart which was heavy with the terrible events he had learned of in the morning.\nThe martial arts master Zhao Dahu wore an outfit of short athletic robes, consisting of a black top and grey pants. On his back, he carried a giant thick-backed saber that never left his body.\nLu Sheng waited and observed on the side.\nOn the arena, Zhao Dahu trained the servants for a while, then let them train on their own in pairs against each other.\nHe himself, however, approached Lu Sheng. He had noticed Lu Sheng much earlier already.\n\"Young Master, what brought you here today to the arena? Is there something for which you need an old man’s help?\"\nZhao Dahu’s status in the manor was more or less equal to that of Old Master’s.\nThere were also several other martial arts masters whose status was not low and interacted with these young masters and ladies as equals.\nLu Sheng glanced at the servants who were still practicing their moves not far away.\n\"Uncle Zhao, I wish to learn martial arts,\" as the words left Lu Sheng’s mouth, Zhao Dahu’s smile momentarily froze on his face.\n\"Big Brother Sheng, you haven’t come here to pull an old man’s leg, have you?\" [1]\n\"I’m not pulling your leg,\" Lu Sheng shook his head.\nHe had given it more than enough thought. The easiest and the only available way for him to acquire some self-preservation skills was to start by learning from the martial arts masters in his own house.\nAnd among those in the entire Nine Links City, the ones who could best the saber technique of the martial arts master in his own house – Zhao Dahu aka Uncle Zhao – could be counted on one hand.\nZhao Dahu looked at Lu Sheng seriously and shook his head. \"If Brother Sheng is serious about learning martial arts, then what this old man is capable of, I can impart to you. But… you’re too old, so your bones’ shape is fixed and you won’t be able to execute many of the moves properly at all. And if you can’t execute them properly, then the might of this skill will be greatly reduced…\"\n\"It’s fine. Uncle Zhao, just teach it to me.\"\nLu Sheng was not merely seeking some self-preservation skill, but also to test and verify something.\nZhao Dahu fell deep in thought for a moment. Finally, he straightforwardly agreed.\n\"Might as well, then. I’ve got no heir… and having lived with the Lu family for so many years, it’s been a good life and Old Master has been good to us. If we go by the book, you’re learning my craft and so must perform the discipleship ceremony. But given my relationship with the Lu family, forget about becoming my disciple. Just don’t leak my craft out to anyone else,\" Zhao Dahu said with a wave of his hand.\nAs the eldest son in the family, it was only a matter of time before Lu Sheng took over all businesses and properties under the Lu Manor.\nSo, he also harbored intentions of pulling him closer to himself.\n\"But, Brother Sheng, there’s something I need to make clear to you beforehand.\"\n\"Please speak,\" Lu Sheng replied earnestly.\nZhao Dahu caressed the beard on his chin and said in a low voice. \"I know you want to learn martial arts for self-protection because of the terrible Xu family case from this morning. But let me set this straight. Not even the strongest experts in the pugilistic world can handle these strange and weird things, mired in odd mystery as they are. \"\n\"…I got it,\" Lu Sheng nodded. \"I just… feel unsettled. I’ll simply do what I can.\"\n\"As long as Brother Sheng understands.\" Zhao Dahu thought for a moment, then pulled out a small booklet from his chest, wrapped in layers and layers of yellow cloth. Meticulously, he slowly unwrapped it, revealing the booklet underneath.\nSeveral big words were written on the cover: \"Black Tiger Saber Technique.\"\n[1] ED/N: The Big Brother here means something along the lines of \"I’ll flatter you a bit, so stop joking around/messing with me, would you?\" Similar way of addressing others can be often seen in novels in similar situations (the one I’ve seen the most times was Big Brother, followed by Aunt)... or so I thought, but the old codger still keeps on using it, so just keep in mind that it can be used this way…"}]}
