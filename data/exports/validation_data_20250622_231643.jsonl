As he activated the inner Qi and it traveled across his muscles, skin and bone marrow, Lu Sheng felt as if they were on fire.\nBlack Fury Qi emitted from both his shoulders, travelling along the back of his waist and flowing into his right arm before fusing into his right palm and pouring through the long saber.\n\"CHI!!\"\nThe saber blade slashed into the air, making a sound like the shredding of paper, then hacked violently into the tree trunk before him.\nThe stroke struck deeply into the tree, cutting through half of the trunk before it got stuck and stopped.\n‘Great!’\nLu Sheng’s heart leapt for joy.\nHe knew that he had once again made a vast improvement.\nHis body wracked in pain, Lu Sheng dragged himself back into the wooden hut to rest.\nIn the subsequent days, he did absolutely nothing. Other than exercising his body for a little bit, he spent most of his time sleeping and resting.\nAt the very most, he would circulate Jade Crane Skill at a faster rate. Jade Crane Skill could help strengthen and heal his body much faster.\nHe needed to make adequate preparations to break into the subsequent two levels.\nAfter all, there were three levels that he could cultivate in the Black Fury Skill Manual!\n***\nAt the Lu Manor in Nine Links City.\nSister Yu held a basket in her hands, within which were a few hard-boiled eggs, some yellow-bean cakes, and two pieces of wind-dried smoked meat.\nShe made her way out of the Lu Manor through a side door, called out to the door guards, and walked out along a little alley—all these with great familiarity, like a walk in the park.\nNear the mouth of the alley, a few kids with ponytails ran around kickin up a ruckus, hoping to snatch a stick of candied hawthorn fruit from the hands of the kid in the lead.\nSeeing this, Sister Yu sighed. She thought of how Little Eight was just as adorable when he was younger, always running about in front of her, badgering her for a stick of the candied hawthorn fruit.\nShe was only eighteen years old and still young at that time. Each day, she would go to work at the Lu Manor. Occasionally, she would receive some tips that she did not pass to her parents, which counted as some spare change for her to spend.\nShe would then use this money to buy some snacks for Little Eight—he was only about a few years old at that time.\nBut now…\nThinking about how Little Eight seemed to have lost his mind nowadays, Sister Yu felt extremely miserable in her heart.\nShe continued along the main street in front of the Manor entrance and returned to her usual manner, ending her walk down memory lane. She decided to visit each and every stall to buy some knick-knacks for the children at home.\nToday was a rare day off when she had to return home to rest. She intended to select nice little surprises for her husband and children.\n\"Child, my child!\"\nSuddenly, she saw a woman with disheveled appearance. She was sitting dazedly at the corner of the wall, murmuring to herself in a low voice.\nSomehow, she felt that the woman seemed rather familiar, as if she had seen her somewhere before, though she couldn’t quite put her finger on it.\nShe took a few glances, feeling pity for the woman.\nShe then retrieved a cake from her basket and placed it before the woman.\n\"Please eat. This world… hai,\" she sighed.\nShe straightened herself and turned to continue her search for what she needed.\n\"PA.\"\nIn the blink of a moment, she felt an icy cold, wet and slippery hand grabbing tightly onto her own right hand.\n\"Have you seen my child!\"\nThe voice said.\nSister Yu’s heart lurched and she turned around. It was the woman who had been sitting on the floor.\nShe glared fixedly at Sister Yu with a pair of bloodshot eyes, with such intensity that her eyes were seemingly about to pop out of their sockets.\n\"What are you doing? Let go!\"\nSister Yu was frightened as she hurriedly shook herself away with all her might, then retreated two steps back.\n\"Are you mad!?\"\nHowever, that woman seemed not to hear a word as she continued to glare unflinchingly at her.\nInwardly, Sister Yu cursed her bad luck. Turning around, she hurried off with her head low, not intending to do any more shopping. She felt a faint, tingling pain appear in the place where her hand had been grabbed.\nPassing through this street, she took a turn into a small alley as she went on her way home.\nAlthough it was quiet and isolated, it helped her save quite a bit of time as she did not need to make detours.\nThe alley was quite long, with a number of twists and turns along the way. Both sides of the alley were flanked by ordinary single-story houses, their roofs at the level slightly above the height of an average man. In the alley, there were many puddles of dirty water and litter strewn all over the place.\nSister Yu looked at her wrist. The place where she had been grabbed earlier had begun to turn red.\n\"What bad luck! Ai… I’ll need to apply some ointment when I get back.\"\nShe jumped across a dirty puddle, but the pink embroidered flowers on her fabric shoes were nonetheless stained by some of the sewage. Her mood instantly soured even further.\nShe stomped her feet violently on the ground and proceeded onwards a few steps.\n\"Bam.\"\nShe suddenly knocked into someone.\nShe raised her head.\n\"Have you seen my child?\"\nIt was actually the woman from before!\nSister Yu’s heart thumped loudly, as if about to burst forth from her chest.\nShe stumbled many steps backwards, without even noticing that she had directly landed onto the dirty puddle.\n\"You, you, you!!!\"\nThis woman’s bloodshot eyes were locked onto Sister Yu.\n\"Child, my child!\"\nSister Yu turned around, intending to flee.\n\"PA.\"\nAn emaciated hand caught her arm with powerful strength.\n\"Have you seen my child?\"\nThe woman maintained the same wooden, expressionless face as she repeated that same line.\n\"HELP…!\"\nThe sound barely echoed down the alley before it came to a premature end, and deathly silence replaced it...\n***\nThree days later, the Lu Manor.\nSecond Mother Liu Cuiyu’s brows furrowed as she sat on the wooden bench, looking onto the relative of Sister Yu who came to relay some news.\n\"Sister Yu is not back? She applied for leave and left to return home to her family three days ago.\"\nThis burly male relative had the unique stench of mud about him, something characteristic of farmers. With him standing there in the side hall, the space felt somewhat cramped.\n\"Usually, Big Sis would get back way ahead of time, but this time round, the people at home were all waiting and waiting, yet saw no sign of her. So, we got worried… plus, with the many incidents that have happened within the city… anyway, they got me to come here to ask…\"\nLiu Cuiyu shook her head.\n\"She indeed left a long time ago. She even took a few pieces of dried meat and biscuits from the kitchen… After so many days, if she hadn’t gone back, where could she have gone to?\"\nShe began to grow a bit worried.\n\"Bad news! Bad news!\"\nSuddenly, urgent cries of alarm were heard from outside the house.\nA lass, pale and flustered from fright, came running in.\n\"Second Mistress! Bad news! Something has happened to Sister Yu!\"\n\"What happened?!\" Second Mother Liu Cuiyu stood up in an instant, the expression on her face changing.\nThe burly man also turned as white as a sheet of paper as he looked at the lass running in.\n\"Sister Yu’s body has been found by someone in an alley outside the city. It’s been lifeless for a couple of days!\"\nThe lass’ words immediately caused Second Mother and the burly man to be stunned.\n\"Lifeless…?\"\nReeling from the shock, Liu Cuiyu once again sat down.\n***\nSeveral days later…\nLu Sheng savored the feeling of the blade he held in his hands in detail.\nBlack Fury Qi flowed from within his body into the saber’s blade, akin to a wafting hot air that slowly drifted from within him to swiftly dilute into the saber before spreading out to evenly cover the entire blade.\nHis injuries had recovered a great deal.\nHe decided that, on this day, he would once again upgrade the level of Black Fury Skill to reach the second stratum.\nNow, his body was more and more accustomed to the agitation caused by Black Fury Qi. The injuries resulting from upgrading a level should likely be lower than the previous time.\n\"SWOOSH!\"\nHe began to practice Black Tiger Saber Technique.\nBlack Tiger Saber Technique had a total of three moves, but in actuality, it could be further divided into more than ten over variations of moves.\nThrough combining a few of the variations that he had gained enlightenment of with the variations Uncle Zhao had imparted to him, he produced a set of complicated and varied saber strokes.\nIn the open clearing in front of the wooden hut, Lu Sheng clutched the long saber in hand. His whole body flashed as light reflected off the saber in rapid succession and swooshing sounds of the surrounding air being cut rang out.\nThe silver beams of saber light danced around him in a sphere, making it seem like his entire person was cocooned within.\nBlack Tiger Saber Technique was extremely imposing, with multiple hacking and chopping moves that lent a terribly fierce air to it when he trained.\nLu Sheng practiced the three saber moves repeatedly over ten times, causing his blood and Qi to boil. From time to time, Black Fury Qi would fuse into the long saber and add tremendous power to his moves.\nTaking advantage of the blood and Qi coursing through his veins, he promptly kept his saber and called out in his mind.\n‘Deep Blue!’\nThe Modifier screen sprang forth.\nLu Sheng moved quickly. He pressed the Modify button, then concentrated all his focus onto the Black Fury Skill section.\n‘Upgrade Black Fury Skill by one level!’ He commanded silently.\n\"Swish.\"\nImmediately, the state of Black Fury Skill leapt from Level One to Level Two.\nExcept that this time round, the change happened somewhat slowly, and was not as quick as before.\nLu Sheng had just finished modifying when he felt the Black Fury Qi within him increase exponentially. A vast amount of Black Fury Qi seemed to materialize from out of nowhere and grew to two portions roughly the size of one’s fist, circulating at each of his shoulders respectively.\n‘It seems like my body has adapted this time round. Moreover, the Second Level merely increases the overall amount of Black Fury Qi. It should be fine.’\nLu Sheng had read from the manual that the Second Level was the safest of the levels, which was why he dared to directly break into it in the middle of saber practice.\nAfter breaking through to the Second Level, Lu Sheng felt that the reserves inside his body from before had been thoroughly emptied.\nThis was especially the case for the accumulated Jade Crane Skill’s Qi.\nThis was a Qi skill that nourished the body. Ordinarily, his diligent training should have resulted in overflowing Qi that would have gathered and congealed into a ball of Qi at his chest.\nAfter the thickness of the inner Qi had reached its limit, that ball of Qi would indicate that it would begin to increase naturally.\nBut just this one breakthrough of Black Fury Skill depleted the ball of Jade Crane Skill Qi, turning it into nothingness in the blink of an eye.\nAdditionally, the originally thick and sturdy Jade Crane Skill’s inner Qi was immediately reduced to the thickness of an embroidery needle.\nLu Sheng grew in his resolve after his breakthrough into the Second Level. It was now about time for lunch.\n\"Young Master, a new letter has arrived!\"\nLittle Qiao carried the meal box as she walked in from the door of the yard, waving a yellow envelope with a red seal in her other hand.\n\"Let me see it.\"\nLu Sheng kept the saber back into its sheath, hanging on his side, then received the letter Little Qiao brought.\nRetrieving the letter and opening it, he read through it once quickly and his face quickly darkened. Then, he kept the letter.\n\"Little Qiao, it’s time for us to head back,\" he said calmly.\n\"Back to Lu Manor?\"\nLittle Qiao was thrown off guard, but elated.\n\"That’s right, let’s go home,\" Lu Sheng nodded.\nBoth of them packed their bags in a jiffy, finished their lunch and left a note at the entrance to the yard. Then, they headed for Nine Links City in a hurry.\nFrom the wooden hut in the little forest to Nine Links City was a journey of roughly eight or nine miles.\nA long saber hung across Lu Sheng’s back. It was an ordinary saber made of fine iron rather than some famous weapon. However, its strength was in its sturdiness and weightiness, which ensured that it wouldn't get damaged easily.\nBoth of them sped unrelentingly towards Nine Links City. Little Qiao was dead beat; halfway through the journey, she even needed Lu Sheng to carry her for a stretch of distance. That's how she was able to prop herself up to the end.\nLu Sheng was currently practicing Black Fury Skill, on top of which he also diligently practiced saber techniques each day.

But…\"\nFatso was put on a spot. ‘What kind of people attend the Black Meeting? Murderers, robbers, burglars, thieves, people with shady backgrounds! If Brother Sheng accidentally got embroiled in a conflict and got hurt, that’d be really unfortunate.’\n\"But I better keep a low profile, right?\" Lu Sheng smiled. He understood his concern.\nHe was representing not merely himself, but also Nine Links City’s Lu family. Once any mishap happened to him, the Lu Manor would settle scores with Zheng Xiangui for sure.\n\"It’s best that you understand it. Brother Sheng, your identity isn’t like anyone else’s. If it were anyone else, I wouldn’t be so worried…\" Zheng Xiangui sighed.\n\"I got it. Just make the arrangements. I must lay my hands on that thing,\" Lu Sheng insisted.\n\"Sigh…\" Zheng Xiangui sighed helplessly as he complied.\nLu Sheng confirmed the starting time of the Black Meeting with him carefully. Then, he waited while Zheng Xiangui instructed someone to bring over a VIP invitation.\nWith the invitation in hand, he finally left the restaurant.\n\"High-grade cosmetic powder! Ladies, come and take a look!\"\n\"High quality first-grade products from the Central Plains, just imported from Zi Hua City!\"\n\"Blusher that’s exclusively from Purple Sun & Floral Scent. You can’t find it anywhere else!\"\nOn the streets outside the restaurant, hawkers pushed their wooden carts laden with cosmetic powders, inching along the sides of the streets.\nLu Sheng’s glance swept over them. The street in front of him specialized in selling cosmetic products. Many women and ladies loved to shop here.\nA light rain had just fallen on the street, leaving a wet layer on it. The rays of the setting sun reflected off them, dyeing the entire street into a faint red hue.\nLu Sheng breathed out. The moment his breath left his mouth, it condensed into white mist which dispersed gradually.\nHe turned back to look at the restaurant. The Goldfish Restaurant cast a giant shadow under the sun.\nThis was the largest restaurant in Nine Links City and it happened to be its peak hours. Customers streamed in and out of the restaurant incessantly, creating an unusual commotion and din.\nStanding in the shadow of the restaurant, Lu Sheng looked towards both its sides.\nOther places were rather neglected.\nHawkers inched along, pushing their carts with cosmetic goods, moving without stopping in the shade.\nAs Lu Sheng watched on, he thought of buying some gifts for second mother and Yiyi. These cosmetic powders weren’t expensive, and sometimes one could find quality goods that’d serve as fine gifts.\nHe strolled along the streets, trying to pick a good hawker.\nAs the afternoon went on, the streets grew increasingly deserted and many shops closed for the day.\nThe number of people on both sides of the street shrank to just a few. Lu Sheng met them only occasionally.\nThe strange thing was that these hawkers selling cosmetic goods could clearly see that there weren’t many people around them, and yet they still smiled and hawked their goods with great effort.\nHawking yells rose and fell here and there, reverberating across the big empty street.\nLu Sheng’s eyes narrowed, but didn’t think that anything was amiss. ‘Perhaps this is a custom or phenomenon unique to this world.’\nGlancing from left to right, he finally picked a hawker pushing a cart painted in light red. A pole was attached to the cart, and a flag on it that read: \"Central Plains’ Li’s Cosmetic Goods\".\nThe hawker moved along slowly, pushing his cart, with a big smile on his face. He was clad in a grey linen robe and a greyish white melon peel cap.\n‘I think Li’s Cosmetic Goods is quite an established business from the Central Plains.’\nLu Sheng recalled from his memory and slowly headed towards the hawker, intending to pick some quality cosmetic powder for second mother and Yiyi.\nThe hawker gradually moved forward. Near him, a few kids were having fun, chasing each other and playing.\nThe cart went past the children, then turned into a small alley in the shadows.\nLu Sheng guessed that the hawker was probably about to call it a day. So, he hastened his steps, going after him.\n\"Ai! Brother Sheng!\"\nSuddenly, a voice called from behind him. It was a pretty familiar voice, as if from someone he knew.\nLu Sheng turned around to see a tanned, muscular scholar walk towards him in big strides.\n\"Luo Sheng?\" [1]\nHe hesitated for a moment before recognizing him.\nLuo Sheng, aka Luo Junyi, was a classic rich young master in Nine Links City, just like Lu Sheng. But, unlike others, this lad possessed an actual academic degree; he had just passed the prefectural level exam recently and became a xiucai. News was that he had quite the literary flair. [2]\nActually, Luo Junyi had a very ordinary friendship with him. It just so happened that his name coincided with that of a Mount Liang hero, hence Lu Sheng remembered his name after hearing it once.\n\"Brother Sheng, it’s an emergency, an emergency!\" Loo Junyi took two steps towards him, red-faced.\nLu Sheng immediately understood why this dude came looking for him. Although he was a young master of a rich family, he extremely loved gambling and often gambled to his last penny, winding up borrowing money from all over the place.\nIt looked like he had depleted his gambling capital again.\nLu Sheng laughed as he took out ten talents of silver from his waist pouch and handed them over.\n\"How’s your luck today?\"\n\"Acceptable, acceptable, hahaha… I knew I could count on Brother Sheng,\" Luo Junyi took the silver and left hurriedly.\nLu Sheng shook his head. The money was a small matter. Lu family’s business and estate was enormous after all. Somebody would come handing over money just around the corner.\nHe turned to find the hawker selling cosmetic goods again.\nThe hawker’s cart had already entered the alley, leaving only a small half of it outside.\nWith great strides, he swiftly walked over and followed it into the alley.\n\"Eh??\"\nLu Sheng froze in his tracks. This was an alley with a dead end!\nThe alley was empty, without a hawker, a cart or any living soul to be found.\nHis eyes both narrowed to a slit and his body became poised and alert.\nFrom beginning to end, left to right, he carefully examined this blind alley.\nIt was an alley over ten meters long, formed by the greyish black walls of the houses on both sides. At its end, it was blocked by an aged black wall, with a few seals glued across it.\nThe seals of made of white paper and red letters looked dark under the sunset. Their corners flew up, having lost their adhesiveness.\n\"No trapdoors on the walls... where could the cart have gone…?\"\nLu Sheng kept searching his memory. He clearly remembered that the cart had entered this alley between the houses.\nHe backed out of it and saw the few children who were still playing and chasing one another. These kids wore simple clothes and seemed to come from ordinary families.\nLu Sheng plastered on a smiley face and fished out a few bronze coins from his pocket. He caught a little girl who was giving chase.\n\"Little girl, can I ask you something?\"\n\"What do you want to ask, brother? Please ask.\"\nThe little girl sported two ponytails and was nine or ten years-old, her cheeks red and puffy. Perhaps because she was used to playing on the streets, she was unafraid of strangers and replied straightforwardly.\n\"Brother would like to ask - did you see that Li’s Cosmetic Goods cart pass by here just now? Did it enter this alley here?\"\nLu Sheng stuffed two bronze coins into the little girl’s palms. A radiant smile immediately broke out on the little girl’s face.\n\"I didn’t see any cosmetic goods cart, did I? We play here every day. The cosmetic goods carts usually come only in the morning. In the afternoon, they all go over to the antique street.\"\n\"You didn’t see it?\" Lu Sheng was stunned. He felt that the kid was lying.\nBut then he saw the earnest expression on the little girl’s wide-eyed face.\n\"What I said is true. There really weren’t any carts on the streets today. If you don’t believe me, you can go ask others. There’s nothing at all on the streets,\" the rest of the children ran over and voiced their assent.\n\"Yea yea. My mum was even gonna come over to get some stuff, but not even one cart could be seen. It’s really strange.\"\n\"This brother says he just saw a Li’s Cosmetic Goods,\" the little girl pointed at Lu Sheng.\n\"Where? Where?\"\n\"I don’t see it. That’s all that there is to this street.\"\n\"Brother probably saw it in his dreams? Heeheehee…\"\nThe group of lads broke out in laughter and din again.\nThe smile on Lu Sheng’s face gradually vanished. He turned his head to look at the Goldfish Restaurant.\nThe restaurant under the shadow was crowded with business. Its extraordinary liveliness of was in stark contrast to the desertedness of the streets here.\n\"In that case, did you all see…\"\nLu Sheng turned back and his voice froze.\nThe kids around him had all disappeared god-knows-when. All around him, the street was deserted, empty and devoid of anything.\nWithout so much as a single passer-by.\nThe commotion and din of the children had vanished. Logically speaking, it was impossible for children of that age to all instantly disappear without a sound like that.\nLu Sheng was confident in himself. He was, after all, trained in the Black Tiger Saber and could even detect the position of wild wolves just by listening to the wind. And yet, he did not even hear the sound of the children leaving.\nStaring at the desolate and deathly street, a chill went down his spine. He quickly walked towards the Goldfish Restaurant.\n\"Pitter, patter…\"\nThe sounds of his footsteps rang clearer than usual. The more he approached the restaurant, the more he felt a warm sensation on his entire body.\nWhoosh!!\nAll of a sudden, as if he had just broken through the water surface, Lu Sheng felt everything come to life around him, brimming with life and energy.\nOne by one, warm-bodied customers passed by beside him. One of them accidentally knocked into him and hurried to apologize.\nLadies were alighting from horse carriages, smiling as they walked slowly into the restaurant and were led in by waiters.\nStanding before the restaurant, Lu Sheng looked back on the street selling cosmetic goods again. Without knowing when, it was now filled with some passers-by who weren’t there previously.\nIt was worlds apart from the desertedness before.\nLu Sheng sucked in a mouthful of cold air and swiftly hailed a horse carriage.\n\"To the Lu Manor!\"\n\"Alrighty, please sit tight!\"\nWith a whip from the carriage driver, a skinny old horse slowly moved its hooves.\nSeated on the carriage, Lu Sheng’s mind was occupied by what he had encountered.\nThe hawker, the group of children… they were all very abnormal.\n‘Thinking about it now, the smile on the hawker’s face didn’t move a single inch. It felt extremely fake.’\nHis thoughts led towards the terrible Xu family case and, suddenly, the sense of an impending disaster washed over him.\n\"This city is really getting more and more dangerous…\" he mumbled.\nThe horse carriage pulled up shortly outside the Lu Manor gates. Upon seeing Lu Sheng in the carriage, the gatekeeper hurried over.\n\"Young Master, you’ve returned?\"\nThe gatekeeper was surnamed Wang and was the eighth oldest among his siblings. Everybody usually called him Little Eight. He was a smart lad and had only turned seventeen this year. He inherited his father’s job as the gatekeeper of Lu Manor.\nLittle Eight was pretty familiar with Lu Sheng and would often recount the strange rumors and hearsay flying around in and out of the city to him.\nThose were also what Lu Sheng loved to hear.\n\"Is the Old Master in?\" Lu Sheng asked casually after alighting and paying.\n\"Old Master went to the yamen again. The Prefect summoned him.

Or not a hallucination?’\nLu Sheng’s eyes narrowed. He suppressed the doubts in his heart.\n\"I’m fine,\" he replied calmly, straightening his back.\n\"Young Master… Lord Xu and the rest, they all were such good men. Such good officials. How can it be…?\" Little Qiao’s eyes welled up with tears and she started crying.\nLu Sheng stared silently at the Xu family corpses that lay on the floor.\nAll of them were greenish gray and had ligature marks on their necks.\nThe Prefect glanced at them a few times and then left hurriedly, leaving it for the Chief Constable in charge of the case to handle.\nSeveral yamen officials, who were also responsible for investigation, went aside to discuss the case with the Chief Constable.\n\"Young Master, Old Master asks you to come over,\" a servant ran to Lu Sheng and whispered to him while looking sympathetically at the corpses of the Xu family members lying on the ground.\n\"I’ll be right there.\" Lu Sheng glanced at the servant. \"Are you scared?\"\n\"I am scared,\" the servant was merely eighteen or nineteen, yet carried an air of maturity beyond his age about him. \"But, your servant is a refugee from Ju Rong Nation in the east. There’s a famine over there now. Corpses are all over the ground everywhere. Quite a few people even trade their children with each other to eat them. Pitiful scenes like this are commonplace… ai…\"\nHe sighed. But realizing quickly that he was not chatting with one of his friends, he immediately bowed his head.\n\"Commonplace? Are there many of such incidents in Ju Rong nation in the east?\" Lu Sheng asked casually.\nThe servant fell into silence for a moment. \"More than a few.\"\nLu Sheng’s heart tightened.\nWithout a pause in his steps, he quickly walked to the father of his present self – Lu Fang.\nLu Fang. Other name – Quanan, a.k.a. the Golden Dollar Man.\nLu Quanan’s wealth was famous even in the entire Nine Links City. News that the Lu and Xu Family were about to be joined by marriage had also spread throughout the city. Even people from Zi Hua City in the west had come to present their wedding gifts.\nTo think that a topic as hot and event as celebrated as this would come to end in such a manner.\nPresently, Lu Quanan’s face was extremely ugly. Heavy fatigue and worry were visible in his eyes.\n\"Tell Constable Zhao about yesterday’s situation in detail.\"\nHe moved aside to make space for an approaching bearded man.\nIn his mind, Lu Sheng kept replaying what he had heard from Xu Daoran yesterday. He believed that the water ghost case must be related to the Xu Family deaths. So, he recounted his conversation with Xu Daoran the previous day.\nHe didn’t hide anything.\nChief Constable Zhao’s brows knit together. He, too, saw no major clue in the entire affair.\nSeeing that there were no more questions for him, Lu Sheng departed.\nBefore leaving, the yamen’s men began to clean up the corpses.\nLu Sheng stared for a while from the sidelines. When he saw Xu Daoran being lifted up on the stretcher, he sighed and approached a constable nearby and asked,\" Brother, are there any surviving members of the Xu family?\"\nHe thought that if there were any survivors from the Xu family, he would take care of him or her and perhaps even learn some useful information from them.\n\"Nope… they’re all gone. Even their external relatives’ entire families were implicated. Perhaps they’ve still got a few distant relatives in Zi Hua city,\" the constable shook his head and whispered.\nLu Sheng quietly stuffed a silver coin into his hand. Then, taking Little Qiao along with him, he boarded the horse carriage with his family.\nThe horse carriage headed back towards home.\nHowever, the Xu family’s pitiful state was still on everyone’s minds.\nAs the head of the family, Lu Fang aka Lu Quanan assembled everyone for a family meeting and announced that the engagement with Xu family was void from now on and the women were to console Yiyi. Then, he returned by himself to rest in his room.\nOne by one, the young men in the family went out, be it to the winery in the city, or to the brothel and other similar establishments. That was their usual way of numbing themselves to traumatic events.\nAs for the women, they went out to the nearby Red Lotus Temple to pray for peace and protection.\nIdeally, they would come back with a talisman from the Red Lotus priest which would protect the family from invasion by any external evils.\nThe entire Lu family was fraught with fear.\nBut Lu Sheng did not go out. Instead, he brought Little Qiao with him and headed for the library where the family kept its books.\nThe library was in absolute silence. He pushed the doors open and entered to see a plump woman wiping the shelves.\nThe mahogany shelves and furniture as well as the faint light streaming in from the windows gave this place an eerie atmosphere.\nLu Sheng went past the wooden partition blocking the entrance, which featured a circular painting of flowers and birds, sniffing the faint fragrance of wood in the library.\n\"Take your leave first. I’ll read some books by myself and take a rest,\" he instructed.\n\"Yes,\" Little Qiao replied obediently and left together with the plump cleaning woman.\nStanding alone in the library and staring at the rows of shelves before him, Lu Sheng sighed. Then, he began to search the shelves one by one.\nVery quickly, he found some sort of local prefectural record books. Taking all of these books out of the shelves, he began flipping through them one by one.\nUsing the faint light streaming in from the windows, he quickly browsed through one of them from cover to cover.\n\"In the seventy-second year of the Great Song, a man appeared in the outskirts of Nine Links City and slaughtered twelve with a saber in a frenzy. Killed after being surrounded and attacked by yamen constables.\"\n\"In the eighty-fifth year of the Great Song, on the streets in downtown Nine Links City, a man’s head was suddenly separated from his body. Cause of death remains unknown.\"\n\"In the ninety-first year of the Great Song, tourists went missing in the deserted temple outside the city, numbering at least fifteen. Case remains unsolved till the current date.\"\n\"In the ninety-fifth year of the Great Song, the owner of Nine Links City Music Plaza went missing. His limbs were later discovered in four different locations of the city. The corpse had already decomposed into bones despite only four days passing since his death.\"\n\"In the hundred and sixteenth year of the Great Song, a baby’s cry from outside the city was heard at night. Those sent to investigate all went missing. The sounds of crying could be heard for three days before vanishing by themselves.\"\n***\nReading the records of these cases, both big and small, Lu Sheng grew increasingly shocked and terrified. It was deeply unnerving.\nIt was truly no simple feat for people to retain their sanity and live normally in a world like this, grave danger awaiting at every step.\nHe opened another book. It was even more exaggerated than the previous one.\n\"In the hundred and nineteenth year of the Great Song, a blizzard broke out in Nine Links. The Dragon Lord was rumored to have appeared somewhere, causing the snow to stop in three days. Three days later, the blizzard that lasted for more than ten days ended abruptly.\"\n\"In the hundred and twenty-eighth year of the Great Song, fog appeared on the road leading towards Zi Hua City. Those who entered the fog would lose their bearings and appear mysteriously by the coast of the White Frozen Sea several miles away. Ten days later, the fog disappeared.\"\nHaving read till this point, Lu Sheng was almost certain that this world was not as simple as he had thought. Demons, ghosts and monsters probably really existed here.\nAt least he currently knew of no method in this world which could manipulate the weather.\nHe shifted the chair, picked up a flint and lit up the candles on the table. Their bright yellow flame flickered, casting shadows on his face.\n\"If this world is truly as dangerous as I think, then what do I need to protect myself? What can I use to protect myself?\"\nHe asked himself and thought about this question for a moment by the table.\nThen, rising slowly, Lu Sheng blew out the candle and returned all the books on the table to their places on the shelves.\nHe pushed the doors open and stepped out.\n\"Young Master, you’re done reading?\"\nLittle Qiao was dozing off, her back against the door. She was caught by surprise when Lu Sheng suddenly came out, but still reacted quickly.\n\"Mm. Where’s Uncle Zhao now? Do you know?\" Lu Sheng asked casually.\nThere were many surnamed Zhao and of similar age in the Lu Manor, but only one of them was known to all as Uncle Zhao.\nHe was the one whom even Lu Fang addressed as Uncle Zhao, the number one expert and the strongest martial arts master in the Lu family – Zhao Dahu.\n\"Er… at this time of a day Uncle Zhao is usually at the martial arts arena, tempering his bones and training the servants,\" Little Qiao was on good terms with other servants and so was rather well-informed.\n\"Let’s go find him.\"\nLu Sheng thought long and hard. Uncle Zhao was the easiest person within his reach from whom he could learn some self-preservation skills.\nWalking along the path in the manor, Lu Sheng quickly traversed two stretches of sleeping quarters and arrived at the back of the manor.\nAtop a big arena, a white-haired elder was leading more than ten servants in practicing martial arts.\nThe light of the morning sun washed down on them, gradually lightening Lu Sheng’s heart which was heavy with the terrible events he had learned of in the morning.\nThe martial arts master Zhao Dahu wore an outfit of short athletic robes, consisting of a black top and grey pants. On his back, he carried a giant thick-backed saber that never left his body.\nLu Sheng waited and observed on the side.\nOn the arena, Zhao Dahu trained the servants for a while, then let them train on their own in pairs against each other.\nHe himself, however, approached Lu Sheng. He had noticed Lu Sheng much earlier already.\n\"Young Master, what brought you here today to the arena? Is there something for which you need an old man’s help?\"\nZhao Dahu’s status in the manor was more or less equal to that of Old Master’s.\nThere were also several other martial arts masters whose status was not low and interacted with these young masters and ladies as equals.\nLu Sheng glanced at the servants who were still practicing their moves not far away.\n\"Uncle Zhao, I wish to learn martial arts,\" as the words left Lu Sheng’s mouth, Zhao Dahu’s smile momentarily froze on his face.\n\"Big Brother Sheng, you haven’t come here to pull an old man’s leg, have you?\" [1]\n\"I’m not pulling your leg,\" Lu Sheng shook his head.\nHe had given it more than enough thought. The easiest and the only available way for him to acquire some self-preservation skills was to start by learning from the martial arts masters in his own house.\nAnd among those in the entire Nine Links City, the ones who could best the saber technique of the martial arts master in his own house – Zhao Dahu aka Uncle Zhao – could be counted on one hand.\nZhao Dahu looked at Lu Sheng seriously and shook his head. \"If Brother Sheng is serious about learning martial arts, then what this old man is capable of, I can impart to you. But… you’re too old, so your bones’ shape is fixed and you won’t be able to execute many of the moves properly at all. And if you can’t execute them properly, then the might of this skill will be greatly reduced…\"\n\"It’s fine. Uncle Zhao, just teach it to me.\"\nLu Sheng was not merely seeking some self-preservation skill, but also to test and verify something.\nZhao Dahu fell deep in thought for a moment. Finally, he straightforwardly agreed.\n\"Might as well, then. I’ve got no heir… and having lived with the Lu family for so many years, it’s been a good life and Old Master has been good to us. If we go by the book, you’re learning my craft and so must perform the discipleship ceremony. But given my relationship with the Lu family, forget about becoming my disciple. Just don’t leak my craft out to anyone else,\" Zhao Dahu said with a wave of his hand.\nAs the eldest son in the family, it was only a matter of time before Lu Sheng took over all businesses and properties under the Lu Manor.\nSo, he also harbored intentions of pulling him closer to himself.\n\"But, Brother Sheng, there’s something I need to make clear to you beforehand.\"\n\"Please speak,\" Lu Sheng replied earnestly.\nZhao Dahu caressed the beard on his chin and said in a low voice. \"I know you want to learn martial arts for self-protection because of the terrible Xu family case from this morning. But let me set this straight. Not even the strongest experts in the pugilistic world can handle these strange and weird things, mired in odd mystery as they are. \"\n\"…I got it,\" Lu Sheng nodded. \"I just… feel unsettled. I’ll simply do what I can.\"\n\"As long as Brother Sheng understands.\" Zhao Dahu thought for a moment, then pulled out a small booklet from his chest, wrapped in layers and layers of yellow cloth. Meticulously, he slowly unwrapped it, revealing the booklet underneath.\nSeveral big words were written on the cover: \"Black Tiger Saber Technique.\"\n[1] ED/N: The Big Brother here means something along the lines of \"I’ll flatter you a bit, so stop joking around/messing with me, would you?\" Similar way of addressing others can be often seen in novels in similar situations (the one I’ve seen the most times was Big Brother, followed by Aunt)... or so I thought, but the old codger still keeps on using it, so just keep in mind that it can be used this way…"}]}

Travelling to Mountain Edge City, which was far more prosperous than Nine Links City, wasn’t such a bad idea for him either.\n\"Might as well. I’ll go and come back quickly. If I really can learn something from those famed experts, I’ll send someone back with a letter instead,\" Lu Sheng thought for a moment and agreed.\nMountain Edge City was a great distance away from Nine Links City; it was twice as far as Zi Hua City.\nEven with horses running at full pelt, it would still take two days and one night to reach it, not to mention travelling on a carriage.\nAfter Lu Sheng gave his assent, he spent several days hiding at home to practice martial arts and build up his energy reserves.\nMeanwhile, Lu Qingqing continued to venture out every day as per usual. News of her capturing so-and-so would spread every now and then.\nLu Sheng couldn’t keep a leash on her. Neither could anyone else in the Manor. Second Mother, too, could not help but give up after her words fell on deaf ears.\nAfter resting for several days, Lu Sheng prepared to upgrade the few martial arts he had acquired lately.\nGiven his strong foundations in Black Tiger Saber Technique and Jade Crane Skill, he quickly used the Modifier to master Heart-Shattering Palm, modifying it to Level 3 and achieving full mastery of it.\nHe left the rest of the skills untouched, intending to modify them after he thoroughly recovered from his loss of blood and Qi.\nAs for Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade, he intended to practice it slowly on his own as a point of comparison with the other skills.\nThis cycle repeated itself almost till the date of his setting off when another strange event occurred in the city.\nA few hunters who lived in the vicinity of the city had mysteriously vanished on Wan Qing Festival.\nJust a few days ago, some people had seen them bring fox fur and other wildlife products into the city to peddle. Then, all traces of them were wiped off the surface of the earth.\nThey had vanished within Nine Links City, but the incident was noticed only after their families reported them missing to the authorities.\nWhat was crucial, one of the hunters was the cousin of a senior constable in the yamen. That’s what prevented the case from being handled like other similar cases.\nIt seemed like a simple case on the surface, but the moment investigation began, something fishy cropped up.\nThose hunters had taken only one route from beginning to end, disappearing on the street near the Goldfish Restaurant.\nNot a single soul had seen them along the way.\nSo, the constables hurried to investigate along the street near the Goldfish Restaurant.\nBut that place had just been on fire and was now empty. Why would these hunters who came peddling head in that direction?\nAs Lu Sheng puzzled over this, Little Qiao ran over in panic and told him that Lu Qingqing had headed towards the street near Goldfish Restaurant all by herself at midnight.\nIt was now bright as day but she was still nowhere to be seen!\nLu Sheng’s heart skipped a beat. He knew that something had happened to her.\n\"When exactly did Qingqing head there?\" He quickly asked.\n\"Not sure, but it should be during the Chou hour [1] after midnight. Usually Second Young Miss would return before dawn. But this time, she did not, and her servant Little Red told me that Young Miss had instructed her to prepare hot water in her room for her to bathe in.\nIn the end, she waited for a long time but there was no sight of Young Miss, so she panicked!\" Little Qiao swiftly replied.\nLu Sheng was just taking a stroll and resting in the garden. It was his method of relaxation before practicing saberplay.\nWho would have expected such a thing to happen at this time?\n\"Go at once to inform Uncle Zhao and the family head, I’ll head over there first to take a look!\"\n\"Little Eight had already led some men there to check out the situation. He was the one who sent news of Young Miss’ disappearance!\" Little Qiao hurriedly added.\n\"Little Eight…\" Lu Sheng’s eyes narrowed. He remembered he was the manor guard. \"Got it.\"\nSwiftly, he put on an outer coat, equipped himself with the standard-issue long saber from the house, led a horse out from the stable and then rushed towards Goldfish Restaurant without further ado.\nThe entire Lu Manor, from top to bottom, was alarmed. Lu Quanan immediately gave the order for Uncle Zhao to lead his men towards the Goldfish Restaurant. Simultaneously, he sent men to report the case to the authorities at the prefectural yamen.\nA massive network of manpower and connections rapidly extended itself.\nThe first task on hand was to determine if Lu Qingqing had really gone missing instead of merely falling out of the radar for a short time.\n\"Jia!\" [2]\nLu Sheng rode the horse hard, flying along the cold morning streets that were relatively empty at this hour of the day, allowing him to rush forward at great speed.\nIf this was at any other time, even he could not avoid blame for riding so furiously on the busy streets.\nBut this was no ordinary situation.\nLittle Eight’s message that Lu Qingqing had gone missing was but a fuse that ignited Lu Sheng’s nervousness. What really caused his grave concern were the strange happenings that he had run into along the street near the Goldfish Restaurant previously.\nThe Yellow Speckled Horse soon arrived at the entrance to the Goldfish Restaurant. [3]\nThe restaurant’s doors were locked tight. The sky had just barely lit up and it was not yet daylight-bright.\nThe street on the side of the restaurant was a patch of soot and mess.\nThe few wooden houses which were being demolished were torn down only halfway due to the fire. The remaining half now mixed with the collapsed rubble, appearing more desolate than usual.\nLu Sheng jumped down from the horse and walked onto the charred street.\n\"KA-CHA…\"\nA crisp sound came from something which he stepped on with his leather shoes.\nLu Sheng reached out to grab onto his saber hilt. Thanks to the two real-life combat situations he experienced, he was now much more composed than before.\nLight scintillated in his eyes as he surveyed the surroundings. Before long, he noticed something out of sorts.\nA deep sword mark was carved into a wooden beam in front of the wooden houses in the middle section of the charred street.\nMessy footprints were on the ground, and fresh black soil could even be seen in them.\nLu Sheng reached out to touch the sword marks on the wooden beam. The wooden beam, charred and black on the outside, was pale-yellow on the inside – it was not thoroughly burnt.\nThe sword mark had just hacked open the charred surface, revealing the pale wood texture within.\n\"Should be nearby.\"\nHe slowly unsheathed his saber and carried it into the house, blade pointing downwards.\nThe ceiling of the wooden house had been thoroughly consumed by the fire. As Lu Sheng walked through the door, he was greeted with a mess of charred furniture, bundles of burnt cloth and some melted god-knows-what.\nBarely a few steps into the house, Lu Sheng discovered another sword mark.\nA charred wooden table was collapsed on its side. Two deep sword marks were carved into its edge and even some steel shards were left on it.\n\"What great strength.\"\nLu Sheng pinched one of the shards between his fingers, surmising it to have come from the steel longsword carried by his second sister Lu Qingqing.\nHe bowed his head to look at the footprints, then hastened towards the backyard of the house.\nStepping through the house, he entered the backyard.\nIn a gap in the backyard wall, a one-eyed muscular man with messy hair wearing a brown leather armor and carrying a thick-backed broad saber was presently cursing and mumbling to himself as he went on sticking something to the wall.\n\"Who’s there!?\"\nHe immediately sensed Lu Sheng as he entered the backyard and stared at him ferociously.\n\"Who’s there? I want to ask you, who the hell are you?\"\nLu Sheng sized him up in an instant.\nThe man was almost 1.9 meters tall, and muscles bulged like rats all over his body. Coupled with the silver thick-backed broad saber, still stained with traces of blood, a savage and beastly aura emanated off him.\n\"Me?\" The man chuckled and tossed away the paper in his hand.\n\"Looks like you’re that brat girl’s family? That brat actually dared to kill two of my disciples. So, big bro and I captured her. Too bad you’re too late. That brat girl has been sent back to the stronghold by my big bro for his enjoyment.\"\n\"Brat girl?\" Lu Sheng’s eyes grew dark. \"Seeing your mannerism, I’m sure you’re not just a nobody. I bet you’ve heard of my Lu family’s name in Nine Links City too. Why don’t you name a price? Let’s talk it out!\"\n\"Talk your ass! Are you the only one here, brat from the Lu family?\" The man laughed coldly as he stared at Lu Sheng.\n\"My men are behind,\" Lu Sheng didn’t bother to hide that fact. He was facing a seasoned opponent and lying to him was probably futile. So, he might as well speak the truth.\n\"You’re all alone and yet dared to come all the way here... you’ve got guts!\" The man chuckled.\n\"Number Two, Number Three, take him down. Let the Lu family pay a ransom for his life!\"\nRight after his voice fell, two men jumped inside through another gap in the wall, both in brown leather armor. One of them carried a long-hilted axe while the other a Qi Mei Staff. [4]\n\"Just one little brat, I can handle him alone. Godpa, why did you call both of us out?\" One of them complained. [5]\n\"Whoever arrests him first will get the credit!\" The man laughed aloud.\nHearing that, both of them smiled and stared at Lu Sheng as if he were their prey.\n\"Heheheh, what a handsome little boy. He’ll make a nice pair together with that brat girl. It’s not a bad idea to take turns playing with both of them,\" Number Two stared lustfully at Lu Sheng’s lower body.\n\"Play my ass! If anybody’s gonna play with him, it’s godpa first!\" Number Three spat into his palms.\n\"Break both his legs, but don’t draw too much blood. Otherwise it looks ugly and spoils the mood. That previous one… you hacked off his right arm with your axe and blood splurted everywhere… his body came apart when we did him!\"\n\"That’s none of my business! Didn’t you whack that guy on his back with your staff? When it was our turn, he was almost dead!\" Number Two argued in defense.\nThese two were twin brothers who were blessed with muscular constitution. Once, by chance, they fell under the tutelage of Lin brothers—Phantom Head Blade and Severed Head Blade of Nine Links City and Black Winds Ridge.\nSevered Head Blade Lin Hongshui happened to be none other than the man carrying the thick-backed broad saber.\nPhantom Head Blade—Lin Shuanghuo—and Severed Head Blade—Lin Hongshui—were fugitives who had committed murder in Nine Links City over a decade ago. At that time, both of them had slaughtered two merchant troupes in one night and fled with copious amounts of silver and jewelry.\nThe secret arts that both of them possessed were two sets of Wind-Rippling Saber Techniques, savage in might. Both wielded astonishingly heavy broad sabers.\nThe older among them, Phantom Head Blade Lin Shuanghuo, had set the record of cleaving a live person into two clean halves with one saber stroke during pursuit by constables.\nThis was the first time Lu Sheng faced off squarely with others. Three others at the same time, in fact.\nHe lifted his long saber and looked towards the approaching Number Two and Number Three.\n‘Let me test the waters first with a stroke. I’m outnumbered… if it doesn’t work, I’ll retreat first.’\nHe was a little worried. After all, he had no clear idea of how strong he was right now since he lacked any basis for comparison.\nHence, he was rather careful.\nLu Sheng used neither Black Tiger Saber Technique nor Heart-Shattering Palm.\nRather, he used Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade, which he had been routinely practicing by himself. He certainly couldn’t reveal all his cards right from the start.\nGrasping the saber hilt a trifle loosely, he gazed towards Number Two.\n\"Come!\" Number Two’s mouth formed a grin as he waved his axe and pointed at his own head.\n\"Little brat’s even got the looks of an expert. Hack here! Here! Your grandpa here will stay still and let you…\"\n\"CHI!!\"\nA silver light flashed across in that moment.\nThe long saber in Lu Sheng’s hands had turned into an agile swallow, leaping across the distance of several meters in a second and slashing horizontally above Number Two’s body in one stroke.\n\"SPLAT!\"\nA human head instantly flew up in the air.\nBlood splattered all over.\nAnd, the entire yard fell into a deathly silence."}]}
