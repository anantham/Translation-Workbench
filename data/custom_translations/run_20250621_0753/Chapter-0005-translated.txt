Chapter 4: Black Tiger Saber Technique (3)

"Practicing martial arts?" Lu Quanan frowned.
"Why are you starting to practice martial arts again?" He was about to reprimand Lu Sheng, but then he recalled the other young masters who were out carousing. Compared to them, Lu Sheng's actions were much more commendable.
The words of rebuke died on his lips as he sighed. "If you’re learning martial arts, learn properly from Uncle Zhao. Don't practice blindly on your own; it's easy to get hurt."
Shaking his head, he turned and walked towards the door. Halfway there, he paused. "Whatever medicinal ingredients you need from the pharmacy, just ask for them. I'll give you two thousand taels of allowance per month."
After saying that, he strode away.
Second Mother Liu Cuiyu gently wiped the sweat from Lu Sheng's forehead with a towel. "Your father is just soft-hearted."
She sighed deeply. "Old Master Xu and your father were sworn brothers.  Now that this has happened, he’s very upset.  It’s good that you’re learning martial arts, but… others start cultivating their foundation from a young age.  At your age, it’s a bit late…"
She rambled on, but Lu Sheng didn't fully register her words. His attention was focused on the newly acquired Black Tiger Saber Technique.
"Truly wondrous…" Lu Sheng narrowed his eyes slightly, appearing to listen to Second Mother while actually sensing the condition of his body.
He flexed his arm muscles. "The muscles in my arms are the same as before, but this sense of familiarity, this feeling as if I've practiced saber techniques for many years… it's simply…"
He then tried flexing his leg muscles.  The muscles in his legs were noticeably easier to exert force with than before. He could clearly sense his strength surging upwards from his feet, all the way to his waist, and then to his arms.
This smooth transmission of force was described in detail in the Black Tiger Saber Technique. It was called Unified Force.
"According to the saber technique, those who practice martial arts usually have a method for mobilizing most of their body's strength.  Those who can mobilize fifty percent of their body's strength are considered skilled. Those who can mobilize eighty percent can enter the so-called Unified Force realm."
Lu Sheng evaluated himself. Based on some of the original body’s memories, he had heard Uncle Zhao and other martial arts instructors discuss this before. The Unified Force realm was pretty much at the top tier in Nine Links City.  Being able to integrate one's strength and unleash it in one go – even an ordinary person with this level of mastery could unleash terrifying strength and speed with a single saber strike, far exceeding that of an average person.
"Uncle Zhao is at the Unified Force realm…" Lu Sheng sighed inwardly. The Modifier's effect was without any discount, causing a huge weight to be lifted from his heart.
"Unfortunately, the Modifier seems to consume a combination of essence, energy, and spirit. Just one modification, and not even for those legendary internal energy cultivation techniques, but just an ordinary external saber technique, almost caused me to suffer severe blood loss and become bedridden…"
Lu Sheng had a vague understanding of the Modifier's nature.  It seemed to be a kind of regulator, capable of imprinting experience, memory, instinct, and martial arts onto the body.
However, this regulation required energy, and the energy consumed seemed to be his essence, energy, and spirit.  Moreover, adjusting body memory and the like wasn’t something that could be accomplished overnight.
"The body is like a pile of materials.  The Modifier likely uses these materials to build a new foundation based on the original, rather than simply transforming muscle strength, bone strength, and so on out of thin air."
Lu Sheng arrived at this conjecture.
The changes in his body over the next few days confirmed his guess.
His body began to recover slowly from the first day, and at the same time, firm muscles slowly developed in his arms, legs, chest, and back.  Furthermore, Lu Sheng clearly felt his sense of pain becoming numb.  A thick layer of calluses gradually formed on the skin of his palms.
His appetite also grew increasingly larger. In order not to appear conspicuous, he would secretly go out every day for extra meals.
He ate four meals at home: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a late-night snack. Outside, he would eat the same amount as he did at home.
After seven days, Lu Sheng's entire body had become noticeably firmer, and his physique was no longer as thin and frail as before.
He had long since returned the saber technique manual to Uncle Zhao.
Uncle Zhao, upon hearing about his illness and confinement to bed, simply shook his head and sighed when he received the manual. He didn't make any other comments and didn't ask about his saber practice.
Lu Sheng guessed that he probably thought he had recklessly attempted to practice the saber technique, resulting in his injury.
Uncle Zhao's thoughts were indeed similar. He had originally been waiting for Lu Sheng to come to him for guidance after encountering difficulties in his practice. He hadn’t expected to hear about Young Master Lu Sheng's injury and confinement to bed. After Lu Sheng returned the manual and didn't ask about the Black Tiger Saber Technique again, he assumed that Lu Sheng had lost interest and given up.
Uncle Zhao sighed but didn't say anything more.
Everything returned to the way it was before. Life in the Lu Manor seemed unaffected by the Xu family tragedy.
The younger generation continued their outings, some enjoying excursions to scenic spots, others indulging in wine and women, while others attended poetry gatherings and flower viewing events.  Nine Links City, though not a metropolis, offered a variety of entertainment.
The older generation continued to attend various gatherings and participate in city council meetings.
Lu Quanan devoted himself entirely to the Chamber of Commerce and his business.
Everyone seemed to have forgotten about the Xu family tragedy and resumed their previous lives.
Only two people were different from before.
One was Lu Yiyi. Without her fiancé, without her beloved, she wept every day, becoming increasingly haggard.
The other was Lu Sheng.
Lu Sheng became more inclined to venture out.
He didn't go out for pleasure or to listen to music, but to a secluded grove outside the city.
There, he began to practice the Black Tiger Saber Technique on his own.

...................

Black Wind Ridge was located southwest of Nine Links City.
The wind howled. It was nighttime.
Lu Sheng took a simple saber from a blacksmith in the city and headed towards this place.  He didn’t aim to reach Black Wind Ridge, but simply intended to find an opportunity to test his saber skills along the way.
He had obtained the Black Tiger Saber Technique through the Modifier and didn’t intend to reveal it.  It would serve as his trump card.
To outsiders, he was just an ordinary, weak young master of a wealthy family.  With such a misconception, if any danger were to target him, this skill would become his greatest reliance for turning the tables.
Of course, this was predicated on the assumption that the Black Tiger Saber Technique experience was truly effective.
Lu Sheng wasn’t clear about the exact location of Black Wind Ridge or its distance from Nine Links City.
Nine Links City didn’t have a curfew, and the city gates remained open at night.  He dressed himself in thick clothes, lowered his head to conceal his face, changed into simple attire, and applied some women's face powder to slightly alter his appearance.
Instantly, he transformed into an unrecognizable ordinary traveler.
Under the cover of night, he left the city and looked into the distance.
The dark, desolate mountains and wilderness resembled a sleeping behemoth, quietly lurking under the moonlight.
His heart was also pounding.
But in order to conceal his identity and to test the true power of the Black Tiger Saber Technique, he stood at the city gate and still mustered the courage to walk in the direction of Black Wind Ridge.
*Ding ding ding…*
Caravans and merchant groups returning at night were entering the city through the main road. The bells hanging from the carriages swayed and chimed in the wind, their sound carrying far into the night.
Lu Sheng exited the city through a side gate.
The city gates of Nine Links City were strange. Not only did they remain open at night, but there were also quite a few of them.  The city walls looked tall and sturdy, but in reality, they were drafty everywhere and served no real protective purpose.
"Arriving at night again today?"
"Indeed…  It’s pitch black at night, and we even broke a wheel on the way.  What bad luck…"
The voices of the caravan leader and the city guard officer talking on the main road by the main gate drifted over from afar.
Lu Sheng stood on a small path leading southwest, much narrower than the main road.
The pitch-black side gate had only two torches burning on the city walls. The dim light cast down allowed him to see only about half a meter ahead.
"This truly is ancient times…" Lu Sheng sighed inwardly.
Looking around, three directions were pitch black, with only the lights of Nine Links City behind him.
"No flashlights, no lights…  The wilderness in ancient times is truly a paradise for wild animal hunting."
He hesitated slightly, but the Black Tiger Saber Technique experience surging within his body lessened his fear.
The Black Tiger Mantra contained methods for dealing with such dark environments.
Or rather, the black tiger itself was a skilled hunter in the darkness.  The Black Tiger Saber Technique placed considerable emphasis on listening to the wind and discerning positions, and wasn’t afraid of such environments.
Tightening his belt, Lu Sheng gripped the simple saber and quickened his pace along the small path leading towards Black Wind Ridge.
After walking several hundred meters along the path, he took out a flint from the cloth pouch at his waist, and then took down a small torch he had prepared earlier from his back.
He placed a piece of the flint on the torch head and rubbed the two stones together vigorously.
Sparks flew onto the torch head.
At first, there were only a few red sparks, but soon they spread to the entire torch head.
Finally, there was light in the darkness.
Lu Sheng glanced back; the lights of Nine Links City had already dimmed considerably.
Holding the torch, he slowly walked forward.
"According to the hunter, wild wolves often roam this path at night.  Let's see if I'm lucky."
He didn’t dare to actually go to Black Wind Ridge.  Knowing that this world very likely had ghosts and monsters, he naturally wouldn't venture too far from the city.
If it weren't for the fact that he had tried many methods in the city and couldn't find a good way to test his strength, he wouldn’t have come here alone to try his luck.
After walking a further distance, he soon discovered traces on the ground – the traces of the wild wolf mentioned by the old hunter.
Several oval-shaped droppings resembling white clay.
Lu Sheng poked at the droppings with a stone.
They had already dried and hardened.  When poked, the inside revealed something that looked like nail clippings.
"This is the place…  This pile of droppings should be a few days old.  According to the old hunter, he saw that old wolf here yesterday.  It should be nearby."
Lu Sheng held the torch in one hand and slowly drew the simple saber from his lower back with the other.
The simple saber was a type of blade derived from the integration of military and agricultural tools, with a long handle.
The saber Lu Sheng held had a handle as long as the blade itself.  Removing the blade, it could be used as a farming pole, somewhat similar to a smaller version of a Guan Dao.
Holding it in one hand, he felt a bit awkward.
He decided to stick the torch into a crevice in a nearby rock.
The surrounding area was a rocky field, with jagged rocks and no trees, so there was no fear of fire.
After securing the torch, Lu Sheng carefully took out a paper packet from his waist pouch. Inside the packet was a piece of fresh pork he had cut that afternoon.
He slowly unfolded the oiled paper and placed it on the ground.
The surface of the meat was still bloody, and a strong stench quickly drifted with the wind.
Lu Sheng stepped back a short distance with the saber in hand, hiding behind a large rock and waiting.
The wind was a little cold.
Lu Sheng leaned sideways, his body pressed against a white rock taller than a man, gazing in the direction of the meat.
Time slowly passed.
*Woo…*
Soon, a faint sound drifted in the wind, seemingly the wind, yet also like the whimper of some animal.
Suddenly, a dark shadow pounced from the side.  The reflected light from the torch revealed a pair of gleaming green eyes.
The shadow was incredibly fast.  It pounced on the meat, snatched it up, and ran.
Lu Sheng's heart leaped with joy, and he was about to move.
Suddenly, he felt a chill down his spine.
A gust of cold wind hit his back.
Lu Sheng's eyes widened.  He turned around with the simple saber in hand and delivered a horizontal slash.
