"Is it a hallucination? Is it not a hallucination?" Lu Sheng narrowed his eyes, suppressing the thought.
"I'm fine," he straightened up and replied calmly.
"Young Master… Lord Xu, they were such good people, such good officials, how could they…?" Little Qiao's eyes were brimming with tears, about to start crying again.
Lu Sheng silently looked at the corpses of the Xu family scattered all over the ground. The bodies were all ashen gray, with a ligature mark on each neck.
The Prefect glanced a few times and then hurriedly left, leaving the matter entirely to the Chief Constable of the Criminal Division who was in charge of the case.  Several other government officials responsible for investigating the case were also discussing the details with the Chief Constable.
"Young Master, the Master requests your presence." A servant ran over and whispered to Lu Sheng. As he spoke, he glanced regretfully at the corpses of the Xu family on the ground.
"I'll be right there." Lu Sheng looked at the servant. "Aren't you afraid?"
"I am afraid." The servant was only eighteen or nineteen years old, but his demeanor revealed a maturity that didn't match his age. "But, this humble one escaped from the Ju Rong Kingdom in the east.  There's a famine there now, corpses are everywhere, and many families have even resorted to cannibalism. I've seen plenty of such tragic scenes… sigh…"
He sighed, then immediately realized that the person he was talking to was not one of his usual conversational partners, and quickly lowered his head.
"Seen plenty? Are there many similar incidents in the Ju Rong Kingdom in the east?" Lu Sheng casually asked.
The servant was silent for a moment.  "Quite a few."
Lu Sheng's heart tightened.  However, his feet didn't stop. He quickly walked to his father, Lu Fang.
Lu Fang, courtesy name Quanan, also known as Jin Yuan Weng. Lu Quanan's wealth was renowned throughout Nine Links City. The impending marriage between the Lu and Xu families had long been the talk of the town, and even people from the neighboring Zi Hua City to the west had come to offer congratulatory gifts.
Such a widely celebrated event had now turned into this.
Lu Quanan's face was very grim at this moment, his eyes filled with deep fatigue and worry.
"Tell Chief Constable Zhao about yesterday's situation in detail."
He stepped aside to make way for a bearded man who approached.
Lu Sheng kept replaying Xu Daoran's words from yesterday in his mind. He felt that the water ghost case must be related to the Xu family's deaths.  He immediately recounted his conversation with Xu Daoran from the previous day, without concealing anything.
Chief Constable Zhao frowned, seemingly without any clue.
Seeing that there were no more questions, Lu Sheng excused himself.
Before he left, the yamen officials began to collect the bodies. Lu Sheng stood by and watched for a while. Seeing Xu Daoran being lifted directly onto a stretcher, he sighed, walked closer to a constable, and asked, "Brother, are there any surviving members of the Xu family left?"
He thought that if there were any survivors of the Xu family, he would take care of them. Perhaps he could get some useful information from them.
"None… they're all gone, even the relatives of the extended family were implicated. Perhaps there are a few distant relatives in Zi Hua City," the constable shook his head and whispered.
Lu Sheng discreetly slipped a small piece of silver to him, then took Little Qiao and joined his family, boarding the carriage together.
The carriages returned home one after another.  However, the tragic scene of the Xu family still lingered in everyone's minds.
As the head of the family, Lu Fang, also known as Lu Quanan, called a family meeting and announced that the engagement with the Xu family was now off. After telling the female family members to comfort Yiyi, he went back to his room to rest, looking dejected.
The younger members of the family went out, either to the wineries in the city, or to brothels or music houses. They were often shocked and numbed themselves this way.  The female family members went to the nearby Red Lotus Temple to offer incense and pray to Buddha for safety and protection, hoping to obtain a spirit talisman from the Red Lotus Priest to protect the family from evil spirits.
The entire Lu family was in a state of panic.
Lu Sheng did not go out to carouse.
He took Little Qiao with him to the large study where the family's books were kept.
The study was quiet.
He pushed the door open, and inside, a plump woman was cleaning and wiping the bookshelves.
The crimson bookshelves, furniture, and the dim light from outside the window made the atmosphere somewhat gloomy.
Lu Sheng entered, bypassing the circular wooden screen with flower and bird paintings that blocked the entrance, and smelled the faint scent of wood in the study.
"You may all leave. I'll read some books and rest for a while," he instructed.
"Yes."
Little Qiao responded obediently, then left with the plump cleaning woman.
Lu Sheng stood alone in the study, looking at the rows of bookshelves, and sighed softly.  He started searching the bookshelves one by one.
Soon, he found local county annals and other such record books.
He carried all these books out and began to read them one by one.
By the dim light from outside the window, he quickly finished flipping through a booklet.

‘72nd year of the Great Song Dynasty: A person appeared on the outskirts of Nine Links City, in a state of madness, wielding a knife and killing twelve people in a row, before being shot dead by the yamen constables.’

‘85th year of the Great Song Dynasty: In the downtown area of Nine Links City, a person's head suddenly detached from their body in the middle of the street. Cause of death unknown.’

‘91st year of the Great Song Dynasty: Travelers disappeared from a dilapidated temple outside the city. After the number of missing persons reached fifteen, the case remains unsolved to this day.’

‘95th year of the Great Song Dynasty: The owner of a music house in Nine Links City disappeared. Their limbs were found in four different locations outside the city.  Only four days after death, the body had already decayed into white bones.’

‘116th year of the Great Song Dynasty: The sound of a child crying was heard outside the city at night. All those who went to investigate disappeared.  The crying continued for three days before disappearing on its own.’
…

Looking at the records of these large and small cases and incidents, the more Lu Sheng read, the more alarmed he became, the more uneasy he felt.
In such a world, a world full of danger at every turn, it was truly remarkable that the people here had not gone mad or broken down, and were still able to live their lives.

He opened another booklet.  This booklet was even more exaggerated than the previous one.

‘119th year of the Great Song Dynasty: A heavy snowstorm hit Nine Links City.  It was rumored that the Dragon King had appeared, and the snow stopped within three days.  Three days later, the heavy snowstorm that had lasted for several days suddenly stopped.’

‘128th year of the Great Song Dynasty: A thick fog appeared on the main road leading to Zi Hua City. Those who entered lost their way and would inexplicably appear on the shore of the White Ice Ocean dozens of miles away. Ten days later, the fog disappeared.’

Seeing this, Lu Sheng was almost certain that this world was not as simple as he had thought. Demons, ghosts, and monsters might actually exist. At least, from his current social standing, he could not see how this world had the means to influence the weather.
He shifted his chair, picked up a flint, and lit the candlestick on the table.  The bright yellow candlelight cast flickering shadows on his face.
"If this world is as dangerous as I suspect, what do I need to protect myself? What can I use to protect myself?"  He asked himself.
After pondering at the table for a while, Lu Sheng slowly stood up, blew out the candle, and returned all the books on the table to their original places one by one.  Then, he pushed the door open and stepped out.
"Young Master, have you finished reading?"
Little Qiao was dozing off, leaning against the door. Lu Sheng's sudden exit startled her, but she quickly recovered.
"Yes, where is Uncle Zhao now? Do you know?" Lu Sheng asked casually.
There were many people surnamed Zhao and of advanced age in the Lu Manor, but there was only one who was truly addressed as Uncle Zhao by everyone.  That was the Lu family's top expert, the most skilled martial artist whom Lu Fang called Uncle Zhao—Zhao Dahu.
"Uh… Uncle Zhao is usually at the training grounds at this time, honing his skills and training the house guards."  Little Qiao had a good relationship with the other servants and was relatively well-informed.
"Let's go find him."
Lu Sheng had thought carefully for quite some time and knew that Uncle Zhao was the key to his most readily accessible means of self-preservation.
Following the small paths of the manor, Lu Sheng quickly passed through two residential areas and arrived at the large area behind the manor.
On a large training ground, an elderly man with graying hair was leading about a dozen house guards in practicing martial arts.
The early morning sunlight streamed down, gradually washing away the gruesome events from earlier that morning.
Martial artist Zhao Dahu was dressed in sturdy short robes, a black top and gray trousers, with a thick-backed broadsword that never left his back.
Lu Sheng waited and watched from the side.
After training the house guards for a while, Zhao Dahu let them pair up and practice with each other.  He then walked towards Lu Sheng. He had seen Lu Sheng long ago.
"Young Master, what brings you to the training grounds today? Is there anything you need this old man's help with?" Zhao Dahu's status in the manor was similar to that of the Master.  There were several other martial artists, all of whom held high positions. Compared to the young masters and misses, they mostly interacted on equal terms.
Lu Sheng looked at the house guards who were still practicing martial arts not far away.
"Uncle Zhao, I want to learn martial arts."
As soon as he said these words, the smile on Zhao Dahu's face froze.
"Young Master Sheng, are you joking with this old man?"
"I'm not joking." Lu Sheng shook his head.
He had thought about it for quite some time. Currently, the easiest way for him to learn self-preservation was to first learn martial arts from the family's martial artist.
The family's martial artist, Uncle Zhao, also known as Zhao Dahu, was one of the few in all of Nine Links City whose swordsmanship surpassed others.
Zhao Dahu looked at Lu Sheng seriously and shook his head. "Young Master Sheng, if you really want to learn martial arts, this old man’s skills are not something I can’t pass on to you. But… you’re too old now, your bones have already taken shape, and many movements simply can’t be performed accurately. If the movements aren’t accurate, the power will be greatly reduced…"
"It's fine. Uncle Zhao, just teach me."
Lu Sheng not only wanted to find some means of self-preservation, but also wanted to verify something.
Zhao Dahu pondered for a moment.  He readily agreed. "Alright then. I have no offspring.  I've been in the Lu family for so many years, and life has been good. The Master has been very kind to us.  According to the rules and customs, you should perform a discipleship ceremony to learn from me.  However, given my relationship with the Lu family, let's forget about the ceremony. Just don't pass on what you learn to outsiders."
Zhao Dahu waved his hand.  As the eldest young master, Lu Sheng would sooner or later take over all the Lu family's businesses and industries.  He also wanted to establish a good relationship with him.
"However, Young Master Sheng, there's something I need to make clear to you first."
"Please tell me," Lu Sheng said seriously.
Zhao Dahu stroked his beard on his chin and said in a deep voice, "I know you were spurred by the Xu family's tragedy this morning and want to learn martial arts for self-preservation. But I'm telling you clearly, even the strongest martial arts experts can't deal with those strange and bizarre incidents."
"…I understand…"  Lu Sheng nodded. "I just… feel uneasy. I just want to do what I can."
"It's good that you understand, Young Master Sheng."  Zhao Dahu thought for a moment, then took out a small booklet from his bosom. The booklet was wrapped in layers of yellow cloth.  He carefully unwrapped it, revealing the small booklet inside.
Several large characters were written on the cover of the booklet: ‘Black Tiger Blade Technique’.
