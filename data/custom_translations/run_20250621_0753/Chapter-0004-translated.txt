Chapter 4: Black Tiger Saber Technique (2)
"This is a rudimentary saber technique taught to me by a travelling priest I met in my early years. It’s considered third-rate in the pugilistic world. Don’t underestimate it just because it's third-rate. It has its merits. Even third-rate manuals are worthy of being collected in the libraries of large sects. Take it and have a good look. There are detailed illustrations of the stances within. Try practicing it yourself first. If you’re still determined to learn it after reading it, then come find me. But whether you learn it or not, remember to return this book to me," Zhao Dahu carefully handed the booklet to Lu Sheng.
"Alright!" Lu Sheng knew that this was probably Zhao Dahu’s most prized possession.
The fact that he could hand it over so easily did not mean that Lu Sheng could master this saber technique just by relying on the booklet.
Practicing martial arts was a meticulous task. Many details needed to be corrected, and it wasn’t something that could be easily learned just by following the booklet.
"Thank you, Uncle Zhao!" Lu Sheng received the booklet carefully.
With the Black Tiger Saber manual in hand, he returned straight to his bedroom, shut the door, lit a candle and began to examine the contents by himself.
The Black Tiger Saber Technique. Though called a saber technique, it actually only consisted of three moves. All three were offensive.
No defense, no evasion, only attack.
First move: Tiger’s Malice.
Second move: Tiger’s Might.
Third move: Tiger’s Roar.
The moves were simple, just three different saber trajectories, each producing a different effect.
Lu Sheng got the gist of it after a quick glance. However, simple as these moves were, their power depended on proficiency, on strength and speed.
And strength and speed, in turn, depended on the body's coordination in exerting force.
Therefore, these three saber moves also came with a corresponding set of cultivation techniques. This so-called cultivation technique was about how to integrate the saber technique into one's daily life, thoughts and spirit, so as to maximize its power.
The cultivation technique essentially described methods to regulate one’s mind and spirit.
The moves regulated the external, while the cultivation technique regulated the internal. The two worked in tandem to achieve a state of perfect harmony between essence, energy, and spirit.
The Black Tiger Cultivation Technique had three levels. Each level had no special name, simply being referred to as First Level, Second Level, and Third Level.
Only by mastering the cultivation technique and achieving the proficiency in the external moves as described in the booklet could one be considered to have fully mastered this saber technique.
Gently closing the booklet, Lu Sheng sat by the table in silence for a long time, continuously memorizing and recalling all the processes and difficulties of the Black Tiger Saber Technique in his mind, over and over again.
Then, he silently recited in his heart, "Deep Blue."
Immediately, the interface of the Deep Blue Skill Modifier appeared before his eyes again.
Within the blue frame were numerous small boxes arranged in rows.
The first box in the first row now displayed his current status.
'Lu Sheng – –
Martial Arts:
Black Tiger Saber Technique: Not Started.'
The display was simple, showing only the Black Tiger Saber Technique he had just skimmed through.
"As expected… It’s really not a hallucination!" Lu Sheng's body stiffened.
Not out of fear, but excitement! This world was too dangerous.
He had originally intended to just be a freeloader, living and dying in peace. But now, he felt like he had fallen into a pit of snakes. It seemed as though venomous snakes could emerge from anywhere at any time. One careless mistake, and he could become a minor character in some legendary ghost story, deader than dead.
"But now, at least there's some hope… if this modifier really works…"
Lu Sheng suppressed his excitement and began to recall the functions of the cheating device he had written.
This Deep Blue Modifier's sole function was to modify all the martial arts skills mastered by the game's protagonist.
It could modify the level of a martial art, directly changing it to Mastery or Peak level. However, it could not modify proficiency, nor could it change health points, strength, speed, internal energy, or any other such miscellaneous attributes.
The only thing it could change was the level of a martial art already mastered!
"I see that the only thing that can be modified in the grid is this Black Tiger Saber Technique. So, how should I go about modifying it?"
Lu Sheng began to explore and research.
Alone in his bedroom, he unconsciously flipped through the booklet, his attention focused on the Deep Blue Modifier in his mind.
He meticulously studied the modifier over and over again. Soon, he discovered a tiny button at the very bottom of the modifier.
The button was labeled: "Begin Modification."
"That’s it."
With a thought, Lu Sheng imagined a finger pressing hard on the button.
Instantly, the entire Deep Blue Modifier flickered.
He suddenly felt that he could freely control everything on the modifier.
This feeling was peculiar, but Lu Sheng didn't dwell on it for too long. Instead, he quickly focused his attention on the Black Tiger Saber Technique.
The status after the Black Tiger Saber Technique was 'Not Started.' The moment his attention focused on it, the status jumped.
It became 'Entry Level.'
Lu Sheng's heart leaped with joy. He felt that it was working, and continued to focus his attention on the Black Tiger Saber Technique.
Soon, the status jumped again, becoming 'First Level.'
Then 'Second Level,' 'Third Level'…
"It worked!" Lu Sheng was overjoyed. It seemed the modifier was indeed effective.
He was about to relax his focus when suddenly the Black Tiger Saber Technique jumped again.
'Fourth Level!!'
The Black Tiger Saber Technique had jumped to the Fourth Level!
BOOM!!
The instant the Black Tiger Saber Technique jumped to the Fourth Level, Lu Sheng felt a roar in his mind.
A splitting headache assaulted him, his body trembling violently as if struck by lightning.
Slumped over the table, he took a long time to catch his breath before he could barely lift his head.
There was something wet and slightly fishy under his nose.
Lu Sheng reached out and gently touched it. It was dark red blood.
His vision blurred, his entire body ached, and he felt weak and powerless, even standing up seemed like a strenuous effort.
He looked at his hand; the skin on the back of his hand was deathly pale. His eyes couldn’t stay open; he desperately wanted to sleep.
"This is a sign of severe Qi and blood deficiency!" Although Lu Sheng didn't know medicine, he knew some basic common sense.
He knew that he was probably suffering from severe Qi and blood deficiency.
He sat by the table, barely managing to prop himself up, and put away the booklet before collapsing onto the bed to rest.
"Qiao’er!"
"Young Master? What are your orders?" Little Qiao asked softly from outside the door.
"Go… make me some red date and millet porridge, add some ginseng. The older the better." Lu Sheng spoke with difficulty.
Being a rich young master had its perks. Ordinary families, let alone aged ginseng, even regular ginseng was treated as medicine for emergencies, not as a tonic like Lu Sheng could afford.
Little Qiao acknowledged and quickly went to the kitchen to order the porridge.
Lu Sheng lay on his back on the bed, taking a long time to catch his breath. He still felt dizzy and weak in his limbs.
However, apart from these sensations, he stretched out his hand in astonishment. A familiar, practiced feeling, as if he had been practicing saber techniques for many years, surged from his palm into his mind.
The three moves and three levels of the Black Tiger Saber Technique and its corresponding cultivation technique had somehow become ingrained in his memory.
Not only did he understand the hidden intricacies within the three moves, but he also knew clearly how to coordinate the cultivation technique with the moves, the various methods, levels, and applications.
"It really worked!?" Lu Sheng closed his eyes, ecstatic.
The experiment was a success. Although it seemed to have consumed his body's Qi, blood, and spirit, it was worth it in exchange for mastering the Black Tiger Saber Technique.
"But, the Black Tiger Saber Technique clearly only has three levels. Where did this fourth level come from?"
This was what Lu Sheng couldn't understand.
Moreover, the fourth level of the Black Tiger Saber Technique felt very familiar in his current memory.
It was as if… as if he had created it himself.
The underlying concepts and ideas were not something people of this world could conceive of. Rather, it was more like a combination of some basic principles of modern scientific mechanics.
Although he was just a civil servant in his past life, he had studied university courses like engineering mechanics and human biomechanics.
Before he could think further, Little Qiao had already brought the porridge.
"I happened to make blood-replenishing porridge for Third Miss, also mainly with red dates. Third Miss didn't want it, so I brought it to Young Master first. This is lily and red date羹, which calms the mind and replenishes blood. I've also added ginseng. Would Young Master like to have it?" Little Qiao asked softly, standing outside the door.
"Bring it in," Lu Sheng said in a low voice.
Little Qiao gently pushed the door open and walked in. But as soon as she entered, she saw the bloodstains on Lu Sheng's collar.
"Yo…Yo…Yo…Young Master, what happened to you!?" Little Qiao exclaimed, almost dropping the porridge in her hands.
Lu Sheng gave a wry smile. "I'm fine."
"Still saying you're fine! You're vomiting blood!" Little Qiao's face turned pale with fright.
"I'm really fine…" Lu Sheng said helplessly.
Little Qiao hurried over and handed the porridge to Lu Sheng. "Come, Young Master, have some hot porridge first."
Under her care, Lu Sheng ate the entire bowl of porridge, mouthful by mouthful.
His heart felt a little more comfortable.
He began to carefully recall the miscellaneous information and experience regarding the Black Tiger Saber Technique that had suddenly appeared in his mind.
Strangely, these things seemed to have always existed in his mind. He could easily understand any difficulty and felt that it would be simple for his body to execute the moves.
If his body wasn't in its current state, he would have gone to the training grounds to find a saber and practice.
After he finished the porridge, Little Qiao quickly left to find the resident physician of the Lu Manor in the pharmacy. She was still worried about Lu Sheng's health.
The Lu Manor had its own dedicated physician, a thin old man with a goatee.
He rushed over with a large medicine box on his back.
Sitting by Lu Sheng's bedside and taking his pulse, his furrowed brows smoothed out.
"Nothing serious, just Qi and blood deficiency, and significant mental exhaustion. A few days of rest and recuperation will do."
He pulled out a piece of paper and quickly wrote down a tonic prescription.
"Take this to the pharmacy. Twice a day, let Young Master take it for ten days, and he should recover."
"Thank you, physician." Lu Sheng was relieved. This was completely consistent with his own judgment.
Soon, Lu Fang, also known as Lu Quanan, arrived.
"What happened?" He came with Lu Sheng's second and third mothers.
Lu Sheng's biological mother had passed away from illness long ago.
He had been raised by his second mother since childhood.
Second Mother Liu Cuiyu had a gentle personality and treated everyone well, showing no difference between him and her own children.
"Just some Qi and blood deficiency from practicing martial arts. It's nothing," Lu Sheng explained to his family one by one.
He was the eldest son of the family, the future pillar who would inherit the family business. Naturally, any problems he had would immediately attract attention.
